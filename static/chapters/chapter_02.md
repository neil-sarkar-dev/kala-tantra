## Chapter 2

Caroline's phone buzzed three days later while she was restocking medical supplies. She nearly dropped the box of gauze when she saw Rajesh's name.

"You better sit down for this," Rajesh said.

She perched on the edge of her desk. "That bad?"

"That bizarre. Remember your proposal? Well, it went up the chain. And up. And up." His voice carried a mix of disbelief and amusement. "Somehow it landed on the desk of the Minister of Development."

"And?"

"They want to modernize the island. The whole thing. Army deployment, medical teams, even telecom infrastructure." Papers shuffled on his end. "They're calling it 'Operation New Dawn' - can you believe this nonsense?"

Caroline's grip tightened on the phone. "When?"

"Two weeks. They're assembling teams now. Listen, Caroline, this isn't what you asked for. It's turned into some kind of PR circus. The minister's talking about 'bringing the Sentinelese into the 21st century.'" He sighed. "They're using your humanitarian concern as cover for a publicity stunt."

"But there will be medical personnel?"

"Yes, a full team. Why aren't you more upset about this? They've hijacked your idea completely."

Caroline looked at the photo on her desk - her brother in his hospital bed, smiling despite the polio that would take him weeks later. "Sometimes good can come from questionable intentions."

"You're not actually considering joining this circus?"

"Someone needs to be there who cares about the people, not the headlines." She sat up straighter. "How do I volunteer?"

"Caroline..." Rajesh's voice softened. "This could be dangerous. These people have never wanted contact."

"Neither did the villagers in Madhya Pradesh during the cholera outbreak. Sometimes we have to help, even when they're afraid of us."

Rohan stared at his monitor, the endless rows of Excel data blurring before his eyes. Another cost analysis for another telecom project. His fingers hovered over the keyboard, mind wandering to the news about Sentinel Island he'd seen days ago.

The door burst open. "Rohan! Just the man I needed." Mr. Kapoor strode in, tablet in hand, his usual energy filling the small office space.

"Sir?" Rohan minimized his spreadsheet.

"Remember that 5G expansion model you built for the Himachal Pradesh project? The one with the remote village coverage calculations?"

"The terrain mapping algorithm?" Rohan sat up straighter. Finally, something interesting.

"Exactly. Well, you're not going to believe this, but we just landed a contract with the government." Mr. Kapoor's grin widened. "They want a feasibility study for installing telecommunications infrastructure on North Sentinel Island."

Rohan blinked. "The same North Sentinel Island with the-"

"With the uncontacted tribe, yes. Part of some new modernization initiative." Mr. Kapoor waved his hand dismissively. "Look, I know it sounds crazy, but this is huge for us. The Ministry of Development specifically requested you after seeing your work on remote deployments."

"But sir, the Sentinelese are known to be hostile to-"

"The army will handle security. We just need the technical planning. Your planning." Mr. Kapoor tapped his tablet. "This could fast-track your promotion to senior consultant."

Rohan leaned back, his mind racing through the possibilities. After months of mind-numbing corporate projects, here was something truly unique. Something that actually mattered.

"When do we start?"

"Team briefing tomorrow morning. Pack for field work - we'll need preliminary surveys within the month."

Caroline wiped sweat from her brow as she counted medical supplies on the Kolkata dock. Dark clouds loomed overhead, threatening the start of monsoon season. The air hung thick with salt and diesel fumes from the waiting vessel.

"Sister, please sign here." A soldier thrust a clipboard toward her. "Standard waiver for dangerous operations."

Her eyes scanned the document, lingering on phrases like 'hostile engagement' and 'assumption of risk.' Twenty years in India's most desperate regions, yet this mission felt different.

"The natives use primitive weapons," Captain Singh addressed the small group. "Spears, arrows. If engaged, do not return fire unless absolutely necessary. Our priority is peaceful contact."

The young consultant - Rohan, she recalled - raised his hand. "What if the Sentinelese don't want us there?"

"We know how to deal with it." Singh brushed him off.

Caroline helped the other aid workers load boxes of antibiotics and basic medical supplies. Three of them plus herself - barely enough for a proper clinic. The two soldiers carried their own equipment, speaking in low voices about defensive positions and escape routes.

"Remember," Singh continued, "if they attack, move in formation back to the landing zone. No heroics. No splitting up. Sister Caroline, you and your team stay behind us at all times."

Thunder rolled across the harbor. The boat captain emerged from below deck, gesturing at the clouds. "Need to leave now if we want to beat the weather. Three days to the Andamans, then we wait for a clear window to approach Sentinel."

Caroline shouldered her medical bag, its familiar weight offering little comfort. The gentle rocking of the dock brought back memories of her first mission voyage, decades ago. Such certainty then, such faith. Now she watched Rohan typing rapidly on his laptop, the soldiers checking their gear, her fellow aid workers whispering among themselves. Seven people about to disturb a paradise that had remained untouched for millennia.

"All aboard," Singh called. "Time to make history."

Caroline leaned against the ship's railing, the salt breeze tugging at loose strands of her hair. The young consultant - Rohan - spread his laptop across a metal crate, pulling up topographical maps of North Sentinel Island.

"See this ridge here?" His finger traced along the screen. "That's our target. Highest point on the island, solid bedrock foundation according to geological surveys."

"Quite a hike from the beach." Caroline studied the contour lines. Two decades of traversing rural India had taught her to read terrain. "What exactly are you planning to install?"

"A compact solar-powered telecom tower. Latest tech, minimal footprint." Rohan's eyes lit up as he zoomed into the technical specs. "Self-contained unit with satellite uplink. Once it's running, future aid missions will have real-time communication with the mainland."

"And you're certain it will survive the elements?" Caroline remembered countless pieces of medical equipment corroded by the tropical climate.

"Built for extreme conditions." Rohan pulled up another diagram. "The casing's rated for cyclones, lightning strikes, you name it. Triple-redundant power systems, hardened against electromagnetic interference."

"Your enthusiasm for the technical aspects is admirable." Caroline's attention drifted to the horizon where North Sentinel Island waited. "Though I suspect our biggest challenge won't be the equipment."

"The Sentinelese." Rohan closed his laptop. "I've read every anthropological report available. Their isolation is unprecedented in modern times."

"Twenty years in rural medicine, and I've learned technology alone rarely solves human problems." Caroline straightened her posture. "These people have rejected outside contact for centuries. A telecom tower won't change that overnight."

"Maybe not, but it's a start. A way to bridge the gap." Rohan's optimism carried the earnestness of youth. "Besides, the tower's designed to be unobtrusive. They might not even notice it once it's installed."

Caroline nodded, though experience had taught her that change - no matter how well-intentioned - rarely went unnoticed. The morning sun climbed higher, and she could make out more details of their destination on the horizon.

Rohan gripped the boat's railing, his knuckles white as another wave rocked their vessel. The thirty-foot research boat pitched in the choppy waters of the Bay of Bengal. Rain pelted the deck in sheets, and the grey sky blended seamlessly into the darker waters at the horizon.

Captain Singh stood at the helm, his weathered face fixed forward while Private Ravi checked their heading on the navigation equipment. Near the cabin, Anika and Arya huddled under a tarp, both aid workers looking as queasy as Rohan felt.

"Here." Caroline pressed two small pills into his palm. "Anti-nausea medication. Should help with the seasickness."

Rohan swallowed them dry, fighting back another wave of nausea. "Thanks. I'd take spreadsheets over this any day."

"You'll find your sea legs soon enough." Caroline leaned against the railing beside him, steady despite the boat's movement. "Though I imagine this is quite different from your consulting work."

"My boss volunteered me for this project. Said my data analysis skills would help document the modernization efforts." Rohan wiped rain from his face. "I've actually been researching Sentinel Island for years - the mysteries, the isolation. But I planned to study it from my desk, not..." He gestured at the churning waters.

"Having second thoughts about meeting the Sentinelese?"

"They've killed everyone who's tried to contact them. What makes us think this time will be different?"

Caroline's expression softened. "That's why I'm here. Twenty years running a rural clinic in India taught me that medical care can bridge even the widest cultural gaps. The Sentinelese are human beings who get sick, have babies, break bones. They need doctors too."

"What made you volunteer for this specific mission?"

"I've spent my career helping those who need it most. The Sentinelese are perhaps the most isolated people on Earth. If we can improve their health outcomes while respecting their autonomy..." She paused as the boat lurched. "Well, that's worth the risk."

The boat crested another wave, and Rohan's stomach turned. He closed his eyes, focusing on the rain hitting his face instead of the rolling motion beneath his feet.
