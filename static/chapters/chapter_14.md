## Chapter 14

The humid Balinese night pressed against Rohan's skin as he tossed in his hotel bed. His mind churned with images of Sanskrit symbols and geometric patterns until exhaustion finally pulled him under. But this time, sleep brought something different.

Mist curled between ancient stone pillars as Rohan found himself standing at the entrance of the Sacred Monkey Forest. A solitary Hanuman langur perched on a moss-covered statue, its silver fur gleaming despite the pre-dawn darkness. The monkey's eyes held an intelligence that pierced through Rohan's analytical defenses.

"This isn't like the other dreams," Rohan whispered, his voice steady for the first time in days.

The langur leaped from its perch and moved with purpose through the forest path. Rohan followed, his bare feet barely touching the damp earth. They passed through the gateway of Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal, where weathered stone guardians stood eternal watch. On the temple walls, carved reliefs emerged from centuries of vegetation - scenes of priests wielding sacred daggers against writhing forms, their faces frozen in eternal struggle.

The monkey led him to Pura Beji next, where water trickled down ancient spouts shaped like mythical creatures. Here, the carvings showed figures immersed in holy water, dark spirits rising from their bodies like smoke. The geometric patterns that had haunted Rohan's nightmares appeared here too, but transformed - not as implements of evil, but as shields against it.

At Pura Prajapati, the final temple, moonlight filtered through banyan branches to illuminate a series of bas-reliefs. These depicted elaborate rituals, priests arranged in precise formations, using sacred objects to drive out ancient evils. Rohan's hand unconsciously moved to his backpack where the stolen claws rested.

The langur turned to face him, and in its eyes Rohan saw reflections of Hanuman himself - divine warrior, faithful servant, destroyer of evil. The geometric patterns that had tormented his dreams rearranged themselves in his mind, shifting from symbols of terror to tools of salvation.

"Show me," Rohan said, his voice carrying none of his usual need for proof or data. "Show me how to use them."

The monkey's eyes held his gaze, and for the first time since this nightmare began, Rohan felt certainty replace fear. His scientific mind didn't reject this vision - instead, it expanded to embrace a deeper truth. In this sacred space between sleeping and waking, he understood that some knowledge transcended spreadsheets and algorithms.

Dawn painted Bali's sky in watercolor strokes as Rohan stepped through the Sacred Monkey Forest's entrance. His notebook contained rough sketches from his vision, though the reality of the ancient stones struck him differently in daylight. A cluster of macaques parted before him, their eyes tracking his movement with unsettling focus.

At Pura Dalem Agung, Rohan traced his fingers over worn carvings. The morning light caught the edges of Sanskrit letters that matched his photographs from North Sentinel Island. His corporate-trained mind cataloged each similarity - the slope of curves, the depth of cuts, the precise spacing that defied coincidence.

"These aren't random matches," he muttered, photographing a particular sequence. The resident monkeys gathered on the temple roof, their silence a stark contrast to their usual chattering.

The path to Pura Beji led through a grove of banyan trees. Their aerial roots created a natural maze, casting complex shadows across the stone steps. Here, the carvings showed purification rituals. Rohan recognized the geometric arrangements - identical to those in the Sentinelese cave, but reversed, as if designed to counter them.

At Pura Prajapati, an aged macaque sat on the temple threshold, its silver fur reminiscent of the one from his dream. It watched as Rohan photographed the ritual scenes depicted on the walls. The Sanskrit inscriptions here matched his research about quarantine protocols from ancient times.

The monkey's steady gaze drew Rohan's attention to a previously overlooked section of wall. Beneath centuries of moss, he found carvings that detailed specific arrangements of priests and ritual objects. His hand brushed the stolen claws in his pocket as he sketched the patterns in his notebook.

Through the shifting canopy light, Rohan pieced together what generations of priests had encoded in stone. These temples weren't just places of worship - they were instruction manuals, preserved in architecture and art, waiting for someone who could read their warnings.

The sterile hospital corridor stretched before Caroline as she made her way to Kirana's office. Her footsteps echoed against the linoleum floors, each step amplified in the late-night quiet. The familiar antiseptic smell mingled with an odd metallic tang that reminded her too much of North Sentinel Island.

Kirana's office door stood ajar, warm lamplight spilling into the hallway. Inside, Kirana sat behind her desk, two cups of steaming tea placed precisely on its surface. Her usually vibrant appearance had dulled - dark circles rimmed her eyes, and her skin held an unhealthy pallor.

"I made chai," Kirana said, gesturing to the cup. "Please, sit."

Caroline lowered herself into the chair, wrapping her fingers around the warm ceramic. "How are you feeling?"

"Better than the children in Madhya Pradesh." Kirana's words cut through the air. "The ones from the measles outbreak in 2009."

Caroline's hand froze mid-lift. She had never spoken of that incident. The cup clattered against its saucer as she set it down.

"Four deaths in three days," Kirana continued, her voice taking on an odd cadence. "Little Priya was the first. You held her hand until the fever took her."

The fluorescent light above them buzzed and flickered. Caroline's throat constricted. "How could you possibly-"

"Or perhaps we should discuss the delivery room in Chennai? 2003. The young mother who trusted you completely." Kirana leaned forward, her eyes reflecting the unstable light. "What was her name again? Ah yes. Lakshmi."

Caroline's chest tightened. The room's temperature seemed to plummet. These were details buried in sealed records, known only to her and God.

"You've been researching me." Caroline's voice wavered.

"Research?" Kirana laughed, a sound that held no trace of her usual warmth. "I know how the blood pooled on the floor. I know her last words. I know the exact moment you realized your mistake." Her voice dropped to a whisper, but somehow filled the entire room. "I know the weight of the stillborn child in your arms."

The overhead light sputtered again, casting strange shadows across Kirana's face. Her features seemed to shift in the unstable illumination, something ancient and terrible moving beneath her skin.

"Stop this," Caroline commanded, but her authority crumbled as Kirana recited the prayer she had whispered over Lakshmi's body - a private moment witnessed by no one.

The chai grew cold between them, forgotten, as Kirana continued to speak in that otherworldly voice, peeling back layers of Caroline's carefully buried past with surgical precision.

Caroline's limbs grew heavy as she gripped the armrests of her chair. The room tilted and swayed, medical certificates on the wall blurring into smears of color. Her medical training kicked in - pupils dilating, motor control failing, consciousness fading. The tea. Her cup sat half-empty, a faint residue coating its bottom.

"What did you give me?" The words came out slurred.

Kirana's face shifted in the flickering light. Her cheekbones seemed sharper, jaw elongated beyond human proportion. "You always blamed yourself, didn't you? For every death. Every mistake."

Caroline tried to stand but her legs wouldn't respond. The shadows behind Kirana writhed and stretched across the walls, defying the office's fluorescent lighting.

"Priya's fever shouldn't have spiked so suddenly." Kirana's voice resonated with unnatural depth. "Lakshmi's labor was progressing normally until the last moment. Haven't you ever wondered why everything went wrong so quickly?"

The truth hit Caroline like a physical blow. Every inexplicable complication, every sudden turn for the worse - moments when she'd done everything right but still lost patients. She'd carried those failures for decades, but they hadn't been failures at all. They'd been orchestrated.

"All those years..." Caroline's tongue felt thick. "You've been... watching me?"

"Not me." Kirana's smile stretched too wide, teeth gleaming like polished bone in the harsh office lighting. "Something far older. Something that feeds on guilt and grief. And you, Caroline, have been such a reliable source." Her voice held an ancient resonance that made Caroline's bones ache.

The darkness pulsed at the edges of Caroline's vision, writhing tendrils that seemed to reach for her with hungry purpose. Her legs weakened, muscles turning to water as an overwhelming vertigo seized her. Her head lolled back as consciousness slipped away, the last thing she saw was Kirana's face - no longer even attempting to maintain its human mask. The smooth brown skin peeled away like old wallpaper, revealing something that Caroline's mind refused to comprehend in her final moments of awareness.
