## Chapter 7

Kirana adjusted the final seal on her hazmat suit's neckline, the familiar click offering little comfort in the oppressive jungle heat. Sweat already pooled at the small of her back.

"This is insane. We should wait for backup." Rohan paced near the cave entrance, his phone's flashlight beam cutting erratic patterns across the ancient Sanskrit markings.

"Time isn't our friend here." Kirana checked her sample collection kit through the suit's thick gloves. "Every hour we delay, more villagers could be exposed."

"At least let me come with you."

"And risk contaminating the samples? Sorry, but I've mapped thousands of viral transmission patterns. This requires absolute precision." She softened her tone at his crestfallen expression. "Besides, someone needs to maintain radio contact with base camp."

The cave mouth gaped before her, a black void framed by twisted banyan roots. The scratch marks on the rocks caught her eye again - fresh grooves that didn't match any tool or animal she recognized from her field studies.

"Those markings." Rohan  pointed at the Sanskrit symbols. "They're different from the beach. Older, but... deliberate."

"Focus on the comms setup. If I'm not back in thirty minutes-"

"Don't. Don't even finish that sentence."

Kirana switched on her helmet-mounted light and adjusted her breathing apparatus. The filtered air tasted metallic, reminiscent of long hours in her BSL-4 lab. But this was different. No clean room protocols. No backup systems. Just ancient stone and darkness ahead.

She took one step toward the entrance, then paused. Kirana squared her shoulders and moved into the darkness.

Kirana's boots crunched on loose gravel as she advanced into the cave. The beam of her helmet light swept methodically across the walls - left to right, top to bottom - just as she'd done countless times collecting samples in Indonesian caves.

Her digital camera clicked, documenting each Sanskrit symbol she encountered. The familiar action steadied her racing pulse. These markings were older than the ones on the beach, their edges worn smooth by time. But their precision remained unsettling - too regular, too intentional for primitive tools.

"Documenting cave entrance markings at ten meters," she reported into her radio. "No sign of bat colonies or other mammalian vectors yet."

Rohan's voice crackled back, distorted by the cave walls. "Signal's getting weak. How's the air quality?"

She checked her wrist-mounted sensor. "Oxygen levels normal. No detected pathogens." The scientific data provided comfort, a shield against the growing weight of darkness around her.

Twenty meters in, the cave narrowed. Her light caught something moving - just condensation on the wall, she told herself. But her hand trembled as she raised the camera, forcing her to steady it against her chest.

The symbols changed here. No longer just Sanskrit, but hybrid forms she'd never encountered in her research. These carvings were centuries old.

"Thirty meters in," she reported, her voice echoing. "Cave formations consistent with-"

Her light beam caught movement again. This time, unmistakable. Something skittered across the cave floor, too fast to identify. Her training screamed at her to maintain distance, but her scientific curiosity pulled her forward. Just a few more meters. Just one clear photo of whatever species might be carrying the pathogen.

The cave air grew heavier, thick with an organic smell her filters couldn't fully block. Her camera's display showed more symbols, but these weren't worn by time. The edges looked fresh, still dusty from carving. And they formed patterns her brain refused to process - geometries that seemed to shift when viewed directly.

The passage widened into a circular chamber, and Kirana's light beam caught the first skull. Her breath hitched. Then another. And another. Hundreds of them, arranged in concentric circles that spread across the chamber floor. The geometric precision of their placement defied natural explanation.

Her scientific mind tried to catalog the evidence - varying states of decomposition, different sizes indicating multiple age groups. But the primal part of her brain screamed to run.

"I've found..." Her voice cracked. She swallowed hard. "I've found evidence of ritualistic activity. Multiple human remains."

Static answered. The radio connection had failed.

Her light traced the patterns. The skulls formed Sanskrit characters when viewed from above - a massive text written in bone. Some were ancient, yellowed with age. Others... others were far too fresh.

In the chamber's center lay a corpse, flesh still clinging to bone. Its hands clutched a ceremonial dagger, its blade dark with what could only be blood. The craftsmanship was unlike anything she'd seen - the handle carved from human bone, inscribed with those same maddening symbols that seemed to writhe at the edge of vision.

Kirana's medical training pushed her forward even as cold sweat trickled down her spine. She had to document this, had to understand the connection to the disease. Her trembling hands raised the camera.

Something brushed past her in the darkness - a cold current of air that carried the scent of decay.

The scream tore from her throat before she could stop it, echoing off the chamber walls in a chorus of terror. Her light caught nothing but shadows, yet the presence grew stronger, pressing against her consciousness like a physical weight.

The darkness rushed in, and Kirana felt herself falling as awareness slipped away.

Caroline pressed a cool cloth to Kirana's forehead as the young virologist's breathing steadied. The makeshift medical tent offered little protection from the oppressive heat, but at least it blocked the unnatural silence of the jungle.

"The patterns, Caroline. You need to see them." Rohan paced the length of the tent, his polished corporate demeanor stripped away. His hand trembled as he ran it through his sweat-dampened hair. "The skulls weren't just placed there - they formed perfect geometric configurations. Like some kind of... mathematical equation written in bone."

Caroline watched his erratic movements, noting how his usual precise gestures had devolved into wild motions. The change unsettled her more than she cared to admit. She'd seen Rohan tackle complex problems with spreadsheets and algorithms, always maintaining that air of analytical detachment. Now his eyes darted between the tent flaps, scanning the tree line as if expecting something to emerge.

"The corpse in the center..." His voice cracked. "The bone dagger it held - the blood stains around it were fresh." He pulled out his phone, fingers shaking so badly he almost dropped it. "I tried to take photos, but there's nothing but static. It's like the cave itself rejected being documented."

A chill ran down Caroline's spine as she watched this transformation. Rohan had arrived on the island armed with satellite data and network plans, approaching their mission with the cool logic of a consultant. Now he stood before her, reduced to frightened glances and fragmented descriptions.

"You have to see it yourself." He gestured toward the mountain, his hand trembling in the air. "The Sanskrit symbols at the entrance - they're older versions of what we saw on the beach. Whatever's happening to the tribe, it started in that cave."

Caroline squeezed Kirana's hand before rising. "Stay with her, Rohan. I need to see this cave myself."

"I'll come with-"

"No." Caroline's tone carried the authority of decades in crisis medicine. "Continue your telecom survey. There's nothing alive in that cave to harm me." Her fingers brushed the small silver crucifix at her neck, a remnant of her early theological training.

The cave entrance yawned before her, ancient Sanskrit symbols etched deep into the rock. Her flashlight beam caught the fresh scratch marks Rohan had mentioned. The symbols triggered memories of dusty manuscripts from her missionary studies - medieval Catholic texts describing demon-worshiping cults. The parallels sent ice through her veins.

Her hands shook as she photographed the walls, each flash illuminating more disturbing connections. These weren't just random carvings. The geometric arrangements echoed diagrams she'd seen in those forbidden texts, but with Sanskrit characters instead of Latin.

The chamber of skulls stretched before her. Their precise placement formed patterns she recognized from her theological studies - configurations that transcended religious boundaries, appearing in texts from multiple faiths across continents and millennia. Her medical rationality crumbled as she documented everything with trembling fingers.

The withered corpse lay exactly as Rohan  described. Caroline's breath caught as she studied the dark stains surrounding it. Her flashlight traced the pattern of dried blood - five points connected by lines. Her fingers clutched her crucifix as recognition dawned.

A pentagram. Ancient symbol of power and protection twisted into something darker.

Cold air brushed her neck. The beam of her flashlight wavered across the walls. Caroline backed toward the entrance, her shoulders rigid with primal fear.

Kirana pressed her forehead against the cool window of the airplane, seeking relief from the feverish heat that radiated through her body. The plane's A/C was barely working. The sample case sat locked between her feet, its contents more precious - and terrifying - than anything she'd transported before. A flight attendant's voice crackled over the intercom, but the words blurred into meaningless noise.

The cave corpse materialized behind her closed eyelids - withered flesh stretched over bones, fingers curved around that ceremonial dagger. Her eyes snapped open. The businessman beside her shot her a concerned glance as she fumbled for her water bottle with shaking hands.

"Just turbulence," she muttered, though the air was smooth as glass.

She pulled out her tablet, desperate to focus on work, but the preliminary test results from the island's samples only deepened her unease. The prion markers defied conventional patterns, showing signs of selective protein folding that shouldn't be possible in nature. Her own notes, usually precise and methodical, trailed off into scattered observations.

A cold sensation crept up her spine, the same otherworldly chill she'd felt in that chamber of skulls. The airplane cabin compressed around her, the recycled air growing thick and suffocating. Her fingers left sweaty prints on the tablet screen as she swiped through her photo documentation.

Kirana blinked hard, but the images persisted. Her scientific mind grasped for rational explanations - stress, fatigue, the lingering effects of whatever had caused her blackout. Yet she couldn't shake the feeling that entering the cave was perhaps a mistake.

The sample case brushed against her ankle, and she jerked away as if burned. Inside those vials, something waited. Something that might explain the impossible test results, the dying Sentinelese, the ancient warnings carved in stone. Or something that was never meant to be understood by modern science at all.

The lab door hissed shut behind Kirana, its familiar pneumatic seal offering none of its usual comfort. Her footsteps echoed across the polished floor as she made her way to her workstation. The space felt different - sterile in a way that made her skin crawl rather than reassure.

She placed the sample case on the stainless steel counter, her reflection distorted in its surface. The electronic lock blinked green as she entered her code, each number feeling like a countdown to something she couldn't name.

"Welcome back, Dr. Wijaya," her lab assistant called from across the room. Kirana barely registered the greeting.

Her hands trembled as she logged the samples into the system. The electron microscope loomed in the corner, its sleek housing a dark mirror. She'd used it countless times to identify new viral strains, to track mutations, to save lives. Now it felt like an ancient artifact, as useless as a stone knife against whatever lurked in those vials.

The temple bells rang outside, their bronze voices carrying through the triple-paned windows. The sound had always grounded her, a reminder of the balance between old and new that defined Bali. Today each note sent ice through her veins.

Kirana pulled up the preliminary results on her monitor. The numbers refused to align with any known pathogen database. The protein structures displayed impossible configurations, defying the basic principles of molecular biology she'd built her career upon.

She reached for a pipette, muscle memory taking over as she prepared to transfer samples for analysis. The instrument slipped from her grip, clattering against the counter. She caught it before it fell, but the sound echoed through the lab like a gunshot.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting harsh shadows across her equipment. The centrifuge, the PCR machine, the mass spectrometer - each piece of cutting-edge technology seemed to mock her with its limitations. These were tools designed to understand the natural world, but what she'd encountered in that cave...

The temple bells chimed again, and Kirana's shoulders tensed. She stared at the sample case, its contents waiting to be processed through tests she suddenly knew would prove inadequate.

Kirana adjusted the microscope's focus for the tenth time, but the sample remained stubbornly bizarre. The protein structures twisted in ways that violated every principle she'd learned at Harvard. She rubbed her eyes, the clock on the wall showing 11:47 PM.

The centrifuge's hum changed pitch, dropping to a low growl. Kirana's head snapped up - she'd calibrated that machine herself last week. The digital display flickered, numbers scrambling before settling back to normal. Just a power fluctuation, she told herself. The ancient temple complex's electrical grid had always been temperamental.

A gecko's tok-tok-tok pierced the night, making her jump. The pipette slipped from her fingers, clattering against the stainless steel counter. Her hand trembled as she retrieved it.

"Get it together," she whispered, straightening her lab coat. The hazmat protocols she'd followed were foolproof. Double containment, negative pressure isolation, full decontamination procedures. She'd handled Ebola with less stringent measures.

The thermostat clicked, sending a blast of cold air through the vents. Kirana shivered, though the temperature readout showed a steady 22°C. The shadows in the corners of the lab seemed to deepen, despite the harsh fluorescent lighting.

She forced her attention back to the microscope. The sample's molecular structure defied categorization - neither virus nor prion nor any known pathogen. Her years of research into emerging tropical diseases offered no framework to understand what she was seeing.

The mass spectrometer beeped an error message, its third failed analysis of the night. Kirana frowned. The machine had never given her trouble before. She initiated a recalibration sequence, trying to ignore how the standard reference sample's readings drifted far outside normal parameters.

A movement caught her eye - just her reflection in the darkened window, she realized, releasing a held breath. The temple bells had fallen silent hours ago, leaving only the whisper of lab equipment and her own pulse in her ears.

Her throat felt dry, scratchy. Probably from talking to herself all night, she reasoned. Not a symptom. Definitely not a symptom. She'd worn full protective gear in that cave. She was safe.

The centrifuge's growl deepened again. Kirana straightened her shoulders and reached for another sample vial. She was a scientist, trained to face the unknown with methodical precision. Yet her hands shook as she prepared the next slide, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something watched from just beyond the circle of light cast by her desk lamp.
