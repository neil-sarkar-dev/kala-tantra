## Chapter 12

Caroline lay motionless in her hotel bed, the distant chants from the temple drifting through her open window like whispered warnings. Her limbs felt heavy and unresponsive, paralyzed by an overwhelming sense of dread that reminded her of those long nights in the clinic when she'd lost patients. The shadows in the corners of her room seemed darker than usual, playing tricks with her vision in the dim light from the street below, making her question her usually reliable perception.

She thought she saw movement in the darkness - a shifting that made her pulse quicken and brought back memories of watching helplessly as disease claimed her brother. Her mind created patterns in the shadows, transforming them into something that seemed to approach her bed with deliberate purpose. The darkness appeared to reach toward her with grasping tendrils, and Caroline's chest tightened with fear, her years of medical experience offering no comfort against this intangible threat.

Her medical training urged her to find a logical explanation - sleep paralysis, perhaps, or the effects of exhaustion - but panic overwhelmed her rational thoughts. She tried to cry out but found herself unable to make a sound, trapped in silence just as she had been during that devastating delivery years ago. The metal of her necklace felt ice-cold against her skin, like the surgical instruments she'd held with trembling hands that fateful night.

The sharp ring of her phone pierced the quiet, startling her with its modern intrusion. The shadows retreated to their corners as if scattered by the sound, and Caroline regained control of her limbs, her trembling hand reaching for the receiver.

A raspy voice croaked through the line, speaking words that made her blood run cold. "Your soul... sister of mercy. Hell hungers for those who pretend at salvation." The words seemed to know her deepest fears, her private guilt.

Caroline jerked awake, her body covered in sweat that felt as cold as the monsoon rains. Morning light filled the room, but did little to ease her anxiety or wash away the lingering terror. Her right hand ached, and when she opened it, she found red marks where she'd been clutching her crucifix throughout the night, the metal having dug into her palm like a punishment she felt she deserved. The indentations matched the scars on her conscience, marking her with physical proof of her inner torment.

Caroline's hands trembled as she gripped her paper coffee cup in the Chennai airport terminal. The bitter liquid had gone cold, but she couldn't bring herself to finish it, her stomach still churning from the previous night. The fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across the waiting area, making her blink more than usual.

"Our gate changed to B7," Rohan said, shifting his backpack for the third time in as many minutes. Dark circles ringed his eyes, and his normally pristine button-down showed wrinkles at the collar.

"Right." Caroline checked her phone again. No messages from Kirana's lab. The screen's brightness hurt her eyes, reminding her how little sleep she'd managed. "Have you heard anything?"

"Not since last night." Rohan adjusted his pack once more, his movements jerky and unnatural. He wouldn't meet her gaze.

They sat in uncomfortable silence, surrounded by early morning travelers. A child cried somewhere in the terminal, the sound making Caroline flinch. She pulled out her phone again, thumbs hovering over the keypad before letting it drop back into her lap.

"Should we try calling?" Rohan asked, his voice tight.

"Better to let her work." Caroline's medical training urged her to maintain control, to focus on the practical steps ahead, but exhaustion made everything feel slightly off-kilter. "She'll contact us if anything changes."

The boarding call came over the speakers. Rohan stood quickly, almost stumbling as he grabbed his backpack. Caroline noticed how carefully he handled it, wondering what electronics equipment he had brought along.

They joined the line, both lost in their own thoughts. Caroline's hands shook as she handed over her boarding pass, earning a concerned look from the gate agent. She forced a professional smile, one she'd perfected over years of reassuring patients, though it felt more like a grimace.

As they walked down the jet bridge, Caroline wondered if she'd be able to close her eyes during the flight without seeing those shadows again.
