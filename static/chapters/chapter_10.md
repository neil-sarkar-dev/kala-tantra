## Chapter 10

Rohan traced his fingers along the worn stone walls as they moved deeper into the temple. The inner sanctum opened into a vast chamber, its vaulted ceiling disappearing into darkness above. Massive stone pillars, each carved with scenes from the Narasimha legend, supported the weight of centuries. Ancient craftsmen had transformed solid rock into flowing forms - lions emerging from columns, warriors locked in eternal combat, celestial dancers frozen mid-step.

"The engineering is incredible." He ran his hand along a perfectly fitted stone joint. "These blocks weigh tons, yet there's barely space for a paper between them. All without modern equipment."

The air grew cooler as they ventured further in, their footsteps echoing off weathered stone floors worn smooth by countless devotees. Afternoon light filtered through narrow windows, casting long shadows across intricate geometric patterns carved into the floor.

"If I was an ancient Indian king, I could get used to this." He gestured at the grandeur around them. "Better than my one-bedroom apartment in Bangalore. Though the commute would be rough."

Caroline shot him a look, but he caught the slight smile she tried to hide.

His attention shifted to a series of panels near ground level. Unlike the dramatic battle scenes above, these depicted what appeared to be ritual preparations - figures arranged in precise geometric formations, holding objects he couldn't quite identify. The same patterns from the cave appeared here, integrated into what looked like ceremonial diagrams.

"These lower carvings feel different." He crouched to examine them closer. "Less artistic, more... instructional. Like an ancient technical manual."

The panels seemed to tell a story, but parts were obscured by centuries of wear. He pulled out his phone, using its flashlight to examine the eroded details, comparing them to the photos from North Sentinel Island stored on his device.

Caroline's phone buzzed against the ancient temple stone where she'd set it. Kirana's name flashed on the screen, hours ahead of their planned check-in. She answered the video call, and her breath caught at the sight of her colleague.

Kirana's lab coat was wrinkled, her usually neat hair escaping its pins. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, and a tremor ran through her hands as she held the phone.

"The samples... there's been a breach." Kirana's voice cracked. "Two of my technicians collapsed this morning. High fever, muscle tremors, just like the Sentinelese."

Caroline pressed her back against the cool temple wall, steadying herself. "How? Your containment protocols-"

"We followed every procedure." Kirana's eyes darted off-screen. "The samples were sealed. But Mai and Surya, they... they started showing symptoms yesterday. Now three more staff members are reporting early signs."

Rohan moved closer to view the screen, his earlier levity about the temple forgotten. "Could it be airborne?"

"I don't know." Kirana wiped her forehead with her sleeve. "The initial tests showed no viral markers, no bacterial agents. But something's spreading. The hospital wing is filling up."

Caroline's mind raced through possibilities - prions, toxins, environmental factors. "Have you contacted the WHO?"

"Local authorities quarantined the facility. They're... they're not letting anyone leave." Kirana's voice dropped to a whisper. "Caroline, I need help. Whatever this is, it's beyond me."

"We're coming." The words left Caroline's mouth before she could second-guess them. "First flight to Bali. We'll bring equipment, supplies-"

"The risk-" Rohan started.

"Is already here," Caroline cut him off. "Pack your things. We leave at dawn."

The call ended with Kirana's tired thank you. Caroline stared at the dark screen, her reflection ghostly against the glass. Another crisis, another race against time. But this time, the enemy had already breached the walls.

Rohan raced to the library before closing, his leather shoes clicking against the polished floor as he checked his watch for the third time in five minutes. The clock was ticking relentlessly, and with his flight to Bali scheduled for tomorrow morning, this was his last chance to gather the research he needed. His usual methodical approach would have to be sacrificed for speed, something that made his analytical mind deeply uncomfortable.

Ancient palm-leaf manuscripts crackled under Rohan's fingers as he worked through the temple's archives. Sweat trickled down his neck in the stuffy room, the ceiling fan's lazy rotation doing little to dispel the heat. The library's wooden shelves stretched toward the shadowed ceiling, stuffed with scrolls and bound texts that smelled of age and palm oil.

"Ten minutes until closing," called the elderly librarian.

Rohan pushed his glasses up and leaned closer to the text, his Hindi translation skills straining against the archaic Sanskrit. The manuscript detailed administrative records from the Majapahit period - trade routes, military campaigns, and... His heart skipped. A reference to North Sentinel Island - a name that sent a chill through Rohan despite the room's oppressive heat. The forbidden isle had haunted maritime logs for centuries, its indigenous people so fiercely isolationist that even the British Empire at its height had abandoned attempts to establish contact.

He grabbed his phone, photographing the relevant pages. The records described the island as "vadha-sthana" - a place of confinement. Further passages revealed the Majapahit Empire had systematically isolated people there who exhibited specific symptoms - violent behavior, geometric obsessions, speaking in ancient tongues. The practice, he discovered, dated back to the empire's earliest Sanskrit texts, when their naval fleet dominated the Bay of Bengal. The Majapahit admirals had designated the island as a quarantine zone, establishing a network of watchtowers along the Andaman coast to intercept any vessels that might stray too close. Their dutiful record-keeping noted how they would sometimes encounter empty ships drifting in those waters, their crews inexplicably vanished but their logbooks filled with increasingly erratic geometric drawings and references to voices in long-dead languages.

"Five minutes," the librarian warned.

Rohan's hands shook as he carefully turned another brittle page. A detailed illustration showed two ornate gauntlets adorned with tiger-like claws. The accompanying text identified them as sacred weapons of Narasimha, kept within the temple complex as a safeguard against dark forces.

The description matched perfectly with marks he'd seen in the Sentinel Island cave. His analytical mind raced through the implications - if these artifacts actually existed, they represented humanity's only documented defense against whatever was spreading from the island.

A diagram indicated their location in a sealed chamber beneath the main shrine. Rohan copied the details into his notebook, his corporate ethics warring with the growing certainty that they needed these artifacts. The thought of stealing from a temple made his stomach turn, but Kirana's terrified voice echoed in his memory.

The lights flickered - closing time. Rohan  gathered his notes, his heart pounding. The choice before him was clear: respect ancient tradition or take action against a threat that was very real and spreading. He slipped his notebook into his bag, the weight of his discovery pressing down like the centuries-old stone above him.
