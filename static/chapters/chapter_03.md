## Chapter 3

North Sentinel Island materialized through the haze - a shadowy mass against the gray horizon. Rohan checked his tablet for the satellite image, but the screen went dark with static. Frustrated, he tucked it into his waterproof bag.

The research vessel slowed as Captain Singh ordered anchor. Metal chain scraped against the hull before sinking into the clouded waters. The sea had transformed from deep blue to an unsettling brown that roiled with the swells.

"Did you see that?" Private Ravi gestured toward a dark shape in the water. "Shark fin."

Anika recoiled from the railing, breathing rapidly. "We're going out in that tiny raft? With sharks?"

Rohan studied the inflatable zodiac being readied below. It seemed desperately small against the endless ocean. His careful planning hadn't accounted for this visceral reality.

"I can't- I can't do this." Anika pressed against the cabin wall, panicking. "The raft will flip, we'll all drown-"

"Breathe with me." Caroline positioned herself before Anika, speaking softly. "In through your nose, out through your mouth. That's it." She held the younger woman's gaze. "The zodiac is designed for these conditions. Captain Singh's crew will lower us safely, and we'll stay together."

"But the sharks-"

"Are more afraid of us than we are of them. I've made this journey dozens of times to reach remote villages." Caroline squeezed Anika's shoulder. "Trust me."

Rohan observed Caroline's effect on the group, her composure spreading to the others. Even Private Ravi's anxious movements ceased. Though Rohan knew the statistics supported their safety, instinct nagged at him that they were trespassing.

The crew packed their supplies in waterproof containers while Caroline helped Anika with her life jacket. Arya clutched her medical kit, tense but resolute. Captain Singh's voice came through the radio, confirming their landing coordinates.

Caroline stepped onto the wet sand, her boots sinking slightly with each step. The beach stretched in a gentle curve, bordered by dense vegetation that dimmed the already weak light filtering through the thick cloud cover. Palm fronds hung limp in the still air, unusually motionless for a tropical shore.

"This doesn't feel right." She adjusted the medical kit on her shoulder. The forest ahead loomed dark and forbidding, the trees growing so close together they formed what looked like a solid wall. Their naturally twisted trunks created deep shadows that made her uneasy.

"The weather report showed clear skies." Rohan checked his satellite phone, frowning at the screen. "No signal. That's not possible with our equipment."

A gust of wind carried the scent of decaying vegetation mixed with an odd metallic note. Caroline's medical training made her think of blood, though she tried to dismiss the thought. The unusual silence struck her - no birds called from the canopy, no insects buzzed in the humid air.

"Where are the Sentinelese?" Captain Singh scanned the treeline through his binoculars. "They usually defend their shores."

The waves behind them struck the shore with hollow sounds that made her increasingly uncomfortable. Caroline's skin prickled. After twenty years in rural medicine, she'd developed an instinct for trouble, and everything about this place felt wrong.

"Look at these marks." Rohan crouched near the tideline, pointing at the sand. The sanskrit symbols they'd seen on the news were faint impressions in the beach, barely distinguishable from natural patterns in the sand.

"We should establish a base camp." Caroline forced herself to focus on practical matters. "Before those clouds-"

A low rumble of thunder cut through her words. The forest's edge seemed more menacing by the minute. She'd visited dozens of tropical islands during her career, but none had felt so unwelcoming. The dense vegetation created an atmosphere of isolation and unease.

Ravi, the young private, shifted nervously beside her. "Ma'am, my grandmother used to tell stories about places like this. Places where-"

"Secure the supplies," Captain Singh barked, cutting him off. "We're losing light."

Caroline followed Captain Singh through a narrow break in the vegetation. The dense canopy above filtered the light into a murky green haze. Her boots crunched over dried leaves and twisted vines that caught at her ankles with each step.

"Satellite imagery shows a cluster of structures two kilometers inland," Captain Singh said, consulting a weatherproof tablet. "The Sentinelese maintain seasonal camps there."

The path widened into a clearing. Massive tree trunks rose like ancient pillars around them, their rough bark casting strange shadows in the dim light. Caroline's medical kit grew heavier against her shoulder, the strap digging into muscles already tense from their landing.

"Stay within visual range," Singh instructed the group. "The undergrowth gets thicker ahead."

A branch snapped somewhere in the forest. Caroline whipped her head around, but saw only shadows between the trees. The back of her neck tingled with unease. She'd felt similar tension before in her clinic during the monsoon season, when leopards would prowl the village edges. But this felt different. More immediate.

"You okay?" Rohan appeared beside her, his corporate polish already wilting in the humidity.

"Fine." She kept her voice steady, professional. No need to spook the younger members of their team with unfounded anxieties. But her eyes continued scanning the forest, searching for movement in the green twilight.

"The shelters should be just beyond that rise," Singh pointed ahead. "Ravi, maintain rear guard. Anika, Arya - stay between us."

They pressed forward. Each step seemed to take them deeper into the isolated forest. The air grew thick and humid, pressing against Caroline's skin like a wet blanket. Her instincts remained on high alert. She found herself checking over her shoulder more frequently, though the dense foliage revealed nothing.

A bird called overhead - a harsh, guttural sound that echoed through the trees. Caroline startled, her hand clutching the strap of her medical kit. She tried to steady her nerves, reminding herself that unfamiliar wildlife sounds were normal in remote locations. Still, she couldn't shake the growing sense of unease as they ventured further into the ancient forest.

She forced her attention back to the path ahead, where Captain Singh was pushing aside a curtain of vines. But the tension remained, raising goosebumps along her arms despite the humid air.

Caroline froze mid-step. Twenty feet ahead, a row of wooden stakes jutted from the earth. Fresh blood dripped down their rough surfaces, pooling in dark patches at their bases. Atop each stake, a cobra's corpse had been mounted, their hoods spread wide in the filtered light.

Her medical training kicked in as she examined the blood patterns. "This is recent. Within the last few hours."

"What kind of ritual is this?" Rohan approached one of the stakes, his analytical mind clearly trying to make sense of the scene. His hand reached toward the markings carved into a nearby tree trunk.

"Don't touch anything." Caroline caught his wrist. The markings resembled the Sanskrit they'd seen on the beach, but these were different - more angular, deeply carved into the bark. They wrapped around the tree trunk in an unsettling pattern that made her head ache.

Anika, the young aid worker, crossed herself. "My grandmother once told me of similar markings in the villages. They said they were used to keep evil spirits at bay."

Captain Singh photographed the scene with his tablet. "Probably just superstition. These tribes have their own belief systems."

Caroline wasn't so sure. In her years treating remote communities, she'd seen her share of protective rituals - but this felt different. The precise placement of the stakes, the careful positioning of the cobras, the methodical spacing of the markings - it spoke of something more calculated than simple superstition.

The blood continued to drip, each drop hitting the forest floor with unnerving clarity in the oppressive silence. Caroline's medical mind couldn't help but calculate the volume - too much for just the snakes. A deep sense of unease settled in her stomach as she studied the scene.

"We should mark this location," Singh said, "but keep moving. The settlement's close."

Caroline nodded, though every instinct urged her to turn back. She'd learned to trust those instincts during disease outbreaks and natural disasters. But this was different - this was something outside her experience, beyond her carefully constructed framework of rational explanation.

The group continued forward, giving the stakes a wide berth. Caroline noticed how the younger team members hurried past, their eyes averted from the grotesque display. Only Rohan lingered, his phone out, trying to capture images of the markings despite the poor lighting conditions that made his screen difficult to focus.

A piercing scream shattered the humid air, echoing through the dense canopy. Caroline's medical instincts took over as she sprinted toward the sound, her boots pounding against the forest floor, decades of emergency response driving her forward. Rohan matched her pace, branches whipping past them as they navigated the treacherous terrain.

They burst into a small clearing where a section of ground had given way. The pit's edges were lined with fresh-cut timber and dead vegetation - a concealed trap, clearly man-made and recently constructed. Caroline dropped to her knees at the edge, her stomach lurching at the sight below, the acrid taste of bile rising in her throat.

Sharp bamboo stakes protruded from the earth like demon's teeth. Ravi lay motionless, his crisp army uniform soaked dark with spreading crimson. His vacant eyes stared skyward, reflecting the patches of sky visible through the canopy.

Arya lay beside him, still moving, still fighting. A stake had pierced her left side, the wound placement making Caroline's heart sink. Each labored breath produced a wet, sucking sound Caroline knew too well from her years in emergency medicine - the sound of a punctured lung slowly filling with blood.

"I need my kit!" Caroline scrambled down the pit's slope, medical training warring with the knowledge that the injury was too severe, too devastating. She pressed her hands around the wound, trying to stabilize the stake, feeling the warm blood seeping between her fingers.

"Stay with me, Arya." But the young aid worker's lips were turning ashen, red staining the corners of her mouth. Her hand clutched Caroline's wrist with surprising strength, nails digging into flesh.

Behind her, Captain Singh unleashed a stream of Hindi curses that echoed off the pit walls. Anika's hysterical sobs filled the air as Rohan held her back from the pit's edge, his usually composed face twisted with horror.

Caroline felt Arya's grip weaken. The girl's eyes locked onto hers, filled with the same trust she'd seen in that delivery room years ago. That same desperate plea for help. That same helpless moment she couldn't prevent, playing out again in this godforsaken jungle.

Arya's breathing stopped. Her hand fell away, leaving bloody fingerprints on Caroline's wrist.

Caroline remained frozen, hands still pressed uselessly against the wound, feeling the body's warmth slowly fading. The forest sounds grew distant, replaced by the memory of another death, another loss. The young mother's face blended with Arya's, both of them gone despite her best efforts, despite all her years of training and experience.

She barely registered Captain Singh's voice calling down to her, or Rohan's hand on her shoulder, gently pulling her away from Arya's body. The familiar weight of failure pressed down on her, threatening to overwhelm, dragging her back to that night in the delivery room, to every patient she couldn't save, to every face that haunted her dreams.

The jungle's thick air transformed into antiseptic-tinged hospital memories. Caroline's mind plunged back twenty-five years, to St. Mary's Children's Ward in Kolkata.

Rows of small beds filled the ward, each holding a child ravaged by cholera. Their sunken eyes and hollow cheeks haunted her, but she'd maintained her composure, convinced they just needed rest and fluids. She'd been so certain, so naive.

Little Priya had smiled at her that morning, accepting a sip of water. "Sister Caroline, tell us another story?" The other children had nodded weakly, their IV bags dripping steadily.

"Later, dear ones. After your medicine." She'd adjusted their sheets, checked their charts, followed every protocol she'd learned. But she'd missed the signs - the racing pulses, the blue-tinged fingertips, the shallow breathing.

By evening rounds, three beds lay empty. Priya's small hand had grown cold in hers. Five more followed before dawn. Their bodies, so light, were carried away while she stood frozen, Sister Margaret's words cutting through her shock.

"You should have called for help sooner. Their dehydration was critical."

The memory fractured as Captain Singh's voice cut through. "Dr. Green! We need to move. This area isn't safe."

Caroline blinked, the hospital ward dissolving back into dense jungle. She forced herself upright, pushing away Rohan's supporting hand. Her fingers trembled as she wiped them against her pants, leaving dark smears of Arya's blood.

The past was the past. She had a responsibility to keep the remaining team alive.
