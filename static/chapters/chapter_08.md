## Chapter 8

Caroline lay on her cot in the medical tent on North Sentinel Island, the canvas walls offering little barrier against the oppressive darkness of the island night. Her fingers traced the worn edges of her missionary's cross - a habit formed over decades of service. The metal felt wrong against her skin, ice-cold despite the stifling tropical air that pressed down on her chest.

Sleep dragged her under like a riptide.

She found herself running through stone corridors, ancient walls decorated with impossible geometries. Behind her, something moved in the shadows - not the shuffle of human feet, but a liquid sliding that made her skin crawl.

"Mṛtyuḥ sarvasya," voices whispered in Sanskrit. "Mors vincit omnia," they responded in Latin. Death conquers all.

Caroline's breath caught in her throat. The languages twisted together in her mind with perfect clarity, though she'd never studied either. The shadows lengthened, stretching into forms that defied natural law. Eyes opened within the darkness - dozens, hundreds, watching her with ancient hunger.

"No." Her voice cracked. "This isn't real."

The shadows converged, revealing faces she recognized from her past - the mother who died under her care, her brother claimed by polio, all the patients she couldn't save. Their eyes multiplied like fractals, each new pair more inhuman than the last.

Caroline jerked awake, sweat soaking through her clothes. The cross burned cold against her sternum. Outside, the jungle's usual nighttime chorus had fallen silent, replaced by a weight of anticipation that pressed against her eardrums.

She reached for her medical bag, seeking comfort in its familiar contents, but stopped short. Caroline squeezed her eyes shut, reciting the Lord's Prayer under her breath. The words felt hollow, as if they wouldn't work.

When she opened her eyes again everything was still in her tent, just her reaction to a bad dream.

It was now morning and Caroline hunched over her laptop in the makeshift command center, cross-referencing patient charts against WHO disease databases. The screen's glow cast a sickly pallor across her hands, which refused to stay steady despite her iron control. She'd triple-checked every entry, but the numbers made no sense - body temperatures that fluctuated by ten degrees within hours, blood work that showed impossible protein structures.

A shadow flickered across her notes. Caroline's head snapped up, but only empty air filled the corner of the room. Her eyes burned from lack of sleep.

"Coffee?" Deepika appeared at her desk, two steaming cups in hand. Dark circles ringed the young aid worker's eyes, her usual bright smile replaced by tight-lipped exhaustion.

"Thanks." Caroline accepted the cup, noting how Deepika's fingers trembled against the ceramic.

"I keep seeing things." Deepika's voice dropped to a whisper. "In the corners. Like... geometric shapes. The ones from-"

"The cave." Caroline's throat tightened. She'd avoided thinking about those patterns, but they invaded her dreams regardless.

Anika joined them, clipboard clutched to her chest. "You too? I thought I was going crazy. Last night I dreamed about triangles inside circles inside squares, but they kept... changing."

"Impossible angles," Private Arjun added from his post by the door. "Like those carvings, but moving."

Caroline's medical training screamed about mass hysteria, shared delusions brought on by stress and isolation. But the rational explanation felt paper-thin against the weight of four separate people describing identical visions.

She pulled up her dream journal - a habit from her early missionary days. Page after page filled with sketches of the same patterns, drawn with mechanical precision despite her shaking hands. The mathematical probability of multiple people sharing such specific dream imagery approached zero.

A shadow passed behind her again. This time, when Caroline turned, but again, nothing.

Back in Bangalore, Rohan slumped in his chair, his reflection in the darkened monitor showing three days of stubble and bloodshot eyes. The Sanskrit symbols from North Sentinel Island filled his screens, their geometric precision mocking his attempts at classification.

"Cross-reference pattern alpha with Sumerian cuneiform," he muttered, fingers flying across the keyboard. His proprietary algorithm highlighted matching sequences, adding another red thread to the digital web he'd created.

The patterns kept repeating - in Mayan codices, Egyptian hieroglyphs, even paleolithic cave paintings. His data visualization software rendered them in three dimensions, revealing structural similarities that defied historical contact between these civilizations.

His phone buzzed. Another missed call from his project manager about the delayed telecom implementation report. He switched it to silent without looking. The symbols demanded his attention, their angles and intersections forming a language that transcended human writing systems.

"This can't be coincidence." He pulled up carbon dating results from similar archaeological finds. The dates clustered around periods of massive societal collapse - the Bronze Age collapse, the fall of Angkor Wat, the disappearance of the Rapa Nui civilization.

The office air conditioning hummed, but sweat beaded on his forehead as he overlaid the pattern frequencies with historical epidemic data. The correlation coefficients were impossible - statistically significant across every major plague outbreak in recorded history.

His eyes burned from staring at screens, making the symbols appear to shift and writhe. He blinked hard, but the movement remained.

"They're not just symbols," he whispered, his corporate training falling away as ancient truths crystallized in his mind. "They're a signature. Something's been leaving its mark across human history."

The patterns spread across his monitors like a digital infection, each iteration more complex than the last. His mapping algorithm revealed a fractal structure - the same forms repeating at every scale, from microscopic to astronomical.

His hands shook as he saved another backup of his findings. Whatever intelligence had created these patterns, it had been communicating long before humans learned to write.

Rohan stood before the boardroom of telecom executives, his laser pointer steady despite his racing heart. The familiar rhythm of corporate presentations should have steadied him, but the Sanskrit symbols lurked at the edges of his vision.

"As you can see from the coverage analysis..." His voice trailed off. The network diagram on the screen twisted, its cell tower patterns rearranging into the precise geometric forms he'd seen in the cave. He blinked hard, but the transformation continued.

"Mr. Kumar?" The CEO leaned forward. "You were saying?"

"Yes, the signal propagation." Rohan clicked to the next slide. The company logo warped, its clean lines mutating into ancient glyphs. "If you examine the wave frequencies, they follow a mathematical sequence identical to patterns found in Sanskrit texts dating back thousands of years."

The room temperature seemed to drop. His audience exchanged glances as he pulled up signal strength graphs.

"These interference patterns." His finger traced the oscillating lines. "They mirror the exact ratios found in the skull chamber- I mean, in traditional telecommunications architecture."

"Skull chamber?" The Technical Director frowned. "That wasn't in the feasibility report."

Sweat dripped down Rohan's back. The PowerPoint slides continued their metamorphosis, corporate data transforming into arcane geometries. Each click revealed new horrors masked as business graphics.

"The island's unique properties affect signal propagation in ways that..." He fought to focus on budget projections, but numbers twisted into symbols he'd seen carved in ancient stone. "The patterns suggest a presence that predates human civilization, manifesting through electromagnetic frequencies."

The CFO's pen stopped scratching. "I thought this was about cell tower placement."

"It is, but the symbols- the signal patterns indicate all kinds of anomalies affecting why typical electronics equipment is so unreliable on the island." Rohan's professional facade cracked. "It's all connected!"

The boardroom lights flickered, casting strange shadows across his carefully prepared slides. The executives stared at their usually composed consultant as he pointed out mystical connections in what should have been a routine infrastructure proposal.

Rohan paced the length of his empty office, his dress shoes crunching over scattered printouts. Red strings crisscrossed the space between cubicle walls, transforming the sterile corporate environment into a web of connections only he could see. His jacket lay discarded on a chair, his collar unbuttoned, tie hanging loose.

"The frequency of the symbols correlates with major plague outbreaks." He gestured at an empty chair. "Look at the pattern distribution across these archaeological sites."

His fingers traced lines between photos pinned to the walls - cave paintings, temple carvings, ancient manuscripts. The red strings formed geometric patterns that matched the cave drawings perfectly.

He muttered in Sanskrit, the ancient words flowing naturally despite his previous struggles with the language. "The texts clearly show the connection between the symbols and mass deaths."

His laptop screen flickered, displaying intricate patterns that shifted and pulsed. Rohan leaned closer, watching the geometries respond to his movements. When he waved his hand, the patterns rippled like water.

"You see? The same mathematical ratios appear in both the electromagnetic interference and the skull arrangements." He pointed excitedly at his empty audience. "The symbols aren't just marking deaths - they're causing them!"

Satellite imagery of North Sentinel Island covered his desk, annotated with his increasingly frantic handwriting. Medical reports from Caroline's examinations lay scattered nearby, their margins filled with Sanskrit translations and geometric analyses.

"The telecommunications infrastructure isn't failing because of technical limitations." He ran his fingers through his disheveled hair. "The island is rejecting modern technology because it interferes with something older. Something that's been there all along."

The overhead lights cast strange shadows across his conspiracy wall, making the red strings seem to writhe and pulse. His laptop continued its impossible display, though the screen remained blank when security cameras later reviewed the footage.

"We're not dealing with a disease." Rohan's voice dropped to a whisper. "We're dealing with a signature."

Kirana rubbed her eyes and squinted at the electron microscope display. The prion proteins from the cerebrospinal fluid samples twisted into familiar yet impossible configurations. She'd been staring at the screen for hours, her third cup of coffee long cold beside her keyboard.

"This can't be right." Her fingers flew across the keys, adjusting the magnification. The protein structures defied known patterns, their folding sequences unlike anything in the medical literature.

The lab's LED lights cast sharp shadows across her workstation. A breeze from the air conditioning stirred her papers, carrying the scent of incense from the small shrine outside her window. The familiar smell transported her back to childhood mornings at the temple, her grandmother's wrinkled hand clasped in hers.

"*Sing katon, sing tan katon.*" The words surfaced unbidden in her mind - an old Kawi phrase her grandmother used to mutter. The seen and unseen. Kirana frowned. She hadn't thought about that in years, couldn't even remember learning it.

Her attention snapped back to the screen as new test results populated her display. The mass spectrometry data made no more sense than the microscopy. She cross-referenced it against known prion diseases, finding partial matches that only deepened the mystery.

"Come on, show me what you are." Her head throbbed as she compiled the data into yet another analysis program. The numbers blurred before her eyes, and she realized she'd been holding her breath.

The quiet hum of equipment filled the lab. Kirana stood and stretched, her joints protesting hours of stillness. She needed fresh air, needed to clear her mind and approach this puzzle with renewed focus. But each time she closed her eyes, fragments of half-remembered temple chants echoed in her thoughts.

Her phone buzzed - another message from Caroline asking for updates. Kirana stared at it, unable to form a coherent response. How could she explain results that defied explanation? The science was there, but it kept slipping through her fingers like smoke.

Kirana's vision blurred as she leaned back from her computer. Her neck cracked - how long had she been hunched over the data? The fluorescent lights above flickered, a subtle disruption that sent a chill down her spine.

She blinked hard, trying to focus. The samples needed one more check under the microscope before she could call it a night. Her hands trembled as she adjusted the slide, an unusual unsteadiness that made her frown.

The lab's familiar hum faded, replaced by a thick silence that pressed against her eardrums. Another light flickered and died, then another, darkness creeping in from the corners of her pristine workspace.

Through the microscope eyepiece, the clear cerebrospinal fluid transformed. Red bloomed across her field of view, dark and viscous. Blood. Fresh blood, impossibly alive with movement.

A sound broke the silence - slow breathing that didn't come from her own lungs. The hair on her arms stood up. The breathing grew closer, accompanied by the soft scratch of something dragging across the lab's tile floor.

Her muscles locked. The rational part of her mind screamed to run, but her body refused to move. The breathing stopped directly behind her.

Cold air brushed the back of her neck. Kirana spun around, her chair squealing against the floor. In the doorway, a shadow stretched toward her - human-shaped tall and menacing, its edges writhing like smoke. An arm-like appendage reached for her face.

The scream tore from her throat before she could stop it, echoing off the lab's sterile walls.

Kirana's eyes snapped open. Her cheek pressed against the lab bench, drool soaking her notes. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting their sterile glow.

Her heart hammered as she pushed herself up. The microscope stood before her, LED blinking green. No blood. No shadows. Just the cerebrospinal fluid sample she'd been studying.

She wiped her mouth and checked her phone. 3:47 AM. Five missed calls from Caroline.

"Pull it together," she croaked into the empty lab.

The air conditioning kicked on, making her jump. She pressed her palms against her eyes, trying to shake the lingering unease. The dream clung like cobwebs, phantom cold breath still on her neck.

Her hands trembled as she shut down equipment. The electron microscope powered down with its clicks and whirs. She sealed the samples, double-checking the locks despite her routine familiarity.

She hung her lab coat carefully. Her reflection in the dark window looked gaunt, eyes shadowed. When had she last eaten or properly slept?

She gathered her things mechanically. The keycard reader chirped as she locked up, its red light alone in the dark hallway. Her footsteps quickened toward the exit.

Night air hit her face, heavy with frangipani and temple incense. She breathed deeply, letting Bali's warmth chase away the nightmare.
