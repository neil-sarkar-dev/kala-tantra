## Chapter 11

Rohan checked his phone one last time - 2:47 AM. The temple grounds stretched before him, a mass of deeper shadows against the dark jungle. His rental car sat hidden behind a bend in the access road, far enough away that its presence wouldn't draw attention. The weight of his backpack pressed against his shoulder blades as he double-checked his supplies: flashlight, detailed sketches from the manuscripts, basic tools, and a first aid kit that felt woefully inadequate given what he was about to attempt.

The jungle pressed close around the temple perimeter. Rohan's shoes crunched on fallen leaves as he picked his way through the underbrush, keeping low and moving slowly. His heart hammered against his ribs. Every rustle in the canopy above made him freeze, his analytical mind cataloging each sound while his nerves screamed at him to run.

A branch snapped somewhere in the darkness. Rohan spun around, flashlight beam cutting through layers of vegetation. Nothing. But the sound of breathing - his own, he told himself - seemed amplified in the thick air. The temple loomed ahead, its ancient stones holding secrets he never thought he'd have to uncover.

Something skittered through the leaves behind him. His pulse spiked as he turned again, the beam of light revealing only more shadows between the trees. The darkness felt alive, watching, judging his transgression. His fingers trembled as he wiped sweat from his forehead. The corporate consultant who lived in spreadsheets and PowerPoints felt very far away.

A soft whoosh overhead made him look up. A Hanuman langur perched on a branch, its long tail curling below like a question mark. The monkey's eyes reflected his flashlight, two points of calm intelligence in the chaos of his fear. It didn't flee or show aggression - just watched him with an almost knowing gaze.

The langur's presence calmed Rohan, recalling tales of Lord Hanuman aiding warriors against Ravana. His grandmother's stories of the monkey god's bravery steadied him. Though he faced sacrilege, this felt right. Ancient Tamil texts told of Hanuman guiding travelers through these forests in the Chola era, when temple routes stretched to Bali. The monkeys were sacred guardians, protecting age-old priestly wisdom. Temple theft once meant a seven-generation curse, but his grandmother had taught him that sometimes breaking sacred rules prevented worse outcomes - like Hanuman stealing a celestial weapon to keep it from evil hands.

The monkey tilted its head, as if considering him, then turned to look toward the temple. Rohan followed its gaze, noting how the angle aligned perfectly with the hidden entrance described in the manuscripts. He took a deep breath and pressed forward, the langur's eyes following his progress through the darkness.

The temple entrance loomed ahead, its carved pillars rising like ancient sentinels against the star-filled sky. Rohan's heart nearly stopped - a flashlight beam swept across the courtyard. A security guard made his rounds, keys jangling at his belt as he checked each doorway.

Rohan pressed himself against a stone column, the rough surface digging into his back. The guard's footsteps drew closer. Sweat trickled down Rohan's neck as he calculated the odds of making it past without detection.

A crash echoed through the courtyard. The guard's flashlight snapped toward the sound. The Hanuman langur had knocked over a tray of fruit offerings, scattering mangoes and bananas across the stone floor. The guard muttered a curse and moved to investigate.

Rohan seized his chance, darting across the moonlit space to the temple's inner door. His trembling fingers worked the lock picks he'd learned to use through countless YouTube tutorials. The ancient lock yielded with a soft click.

The inner sanctum air felt thick, heavy with centuries of prayers and incense. His flashlight revealed worn stone steps leading down to a small chamber. Each step seemed to whisper accusations of sacrilege.

The tomb chamber stretched before him, walls covered in intricate carvings of lion-headed figures. Something shifted in the darkness beyond his light's reach. His rational mind insisted it was just shadows, but every instinct screamed that he wasn't alone.

The artifact chamber lay behind a final barrier - a stone door with a complex geometric lock pattern. Rohan matched it to the diagram from his research, aligning the pieces with shaking hands. The door swung open with a grinding sound that felt impossibly loud.

There they sat - two ornate gauntlets on a stone pedestal, their gold and steel surface untarnished by time. The gauntlets were even more magnificent up close - each one a masterwork of ancient craftsmanship. Four curved tiger claws extended several inches from the knuckle points, their steel edges still lethally sharp after centuries. Rubies glowed like drops of blood where they were set at each knuckle junction, while diamonds arranged in an intricate lotus pattern caught his light and scattered it across the chamber walls. Sanskrit inscriptions ran along the steel base, the characters so precise they might have been carved yesterday. The gold plating showed not a spot of tarnish, making the weapons look more like museum pieces than the ancient tools of divine justice they truly were.

As Rohan  reached for them, the air grew electric. His fingers brushed the cool metal and power surged through his body like lightning, dropping him to his knees. The sensation wasn't painful, but overwhelming - ancient, aware, alive. The claws hummed with energy that seemed to recognize him, judge him, accept him.

He slipped them into his backpack, their weight both physical and spiritual. The theft was complete, but victory felt hollow against the crushing responsibility that settled onto his shoulders.
