## Chapter 15

Caroline's consciousness flickered like a dying bulb. Through the encroaching darkness, she heard footsteps in the hall, then Rohan's muffled voice. "Kirana?"

Her throat constricted, but she forced out a choked cry. The door burst open, fluorescent light from the hallway cutting through the writhing shadows.

Rohan stood frozen for a split second, backlit in the doorway. Above Caroline, Kirana's twisted form loomed, her face a nightmare of stretched skin and impossible angles. The darkness around them pulsed with malevolent purpose.

Rohan slammed into Kirana with his full weight. Caroline's head cleared enough to see them crash into a filing cabinet. Kirana's hands locked around Rohan's throat with inhuman strength, lifting him off his feet. His backpack fell open, spilling its contents. Something metallic glinted on the floor - ornate gauntlets that seemed to radiate their own light.

Fighting against the sedative's pull, Caroline forced her trembling legs to move. Her medical bag lay knocked over by her chair. She fumbled through it, muscle memory guiding her hands to the emergency sedatives.

Kirana slammed Rohan against the wall. Plaster cracked. But his eyes locked with Caroline's, and he managed to gasp out: "The temples... Sacred Monkey Forest... purification rituals..."

Caroline's fingers closed around the syringe. She lunged forward, driving the needle into Kirana's shoulder. Kirana's inhuman shriek cut off as the powerful sedative took hold. Her grip on Rohan loosened, and they all collapsed to the floor.

"The temples," Rohan wheezed, rubbing his throat. "I found ancient texts about exorcism rites. It's our only chance to save her from Hiranyakashipu before the possession becomes permanent."

Caroline checked Kirana's pulse while keeping a wary eye on the shadows that still seemed to twist unnaturally around them. "How long do we have?"

"Not long." Rohan gathered up the fallen gauntlets, their golden surface catching the light. "We need to move now."

Moonlight filtered through the ancient banyan trees as Rohan and Caroline struggled with Kirana's limp form. Their footsteps crunched on fallen leaves, echoing through the Sacred Monkey Forest's oppressive darkness. The air hung thick with incense and decay.

Above them, hundreds of monkeys lined the twisted branches. Their eyes caught the moonlight, reflecting like amber gems as they tracked the group's progress. The creatures' screeches started low, almost musical, building into a rhythmic chant that seemed to pulse through the ground itself.

"The temples," Rohan panted, adjusting his grip on Kirana's shoulders. "Pura Beji is closest. The purification ritual has to happen there."

Caroline nodded, her arms straining under Kirana's legs. The stone temples rose before them, their ancient spires piercing the night sky. Worn statues of demons and gods watched their approach with hollow eyes.

Inside Pura Beji, they laid Kirana's bound form on the central altar. Caroline's hands shook as she uncorked the vessel of holy water. The monkey chorus outside reached a crescendo that made the temple walls vibrate.

The first drops had barely touched Kirana's forehead when her eyes snapped open. Caroline stumbled backward, dropping the vessel. Where Kirana's dark brown eyes had been, golden orbs now stared up at them, each iris swimming with multiple reptilian pupils that moved independently like living things.

"Dear God," Caroline whispered.

Kirana's skin rippled like disturbed water, darkness flowing beneath the surface in oily waves. Her body twisted at impossible angles, bones cracking as her spine curved backward until her head nearly touched her feet.

"The claws," Rohan shouted over the monkeys' frenzy. "We need them now!"

But before he could reach for his pack, Kirana's mouth opened impossibly wide, her jaw unhinging like a snake's. A sound emerged - not her voice, but something ancient and terrible that made the stone walls tremble and the air grow thick with sulfurous smoke.

The darkness beneath her skin coalesced into writhing shadows that lifted her body into the air, her limbs dangling like a broken puppet's. The ropes that bound her dissolved into ash.

Rohan's heart hammered against his ribs as Kirana snapped her restraints like thread. She moved with a fluid, serpentine grace that no human body should possess. Her golden eyes with their multiple pupils fixed on him with predatory focus.

"You dare challenge me with my own weakness?" The voice that emerged from Kirana's throat carried ancient malice. "I am beyond such mortal bounds now."

The sacred space of Pura Beji twisted into something darker as shadows writhed along the stone walls. Caroline backed away, clutching her cross while muttering prayers. The claws of Narasimha burned against Rohan's chest where he'd concealed them, their heat seeming to pulse in time with his racing heart.

A rustle of movement drew his attention upward. Hundreds of eyes gleamed in the darkness - the temple's monkey guardians perched on every surface, their usual playful nature replaced by focused intensity. As one, they launched themselves at Kirana's possessed form, becoming a living wave of fur and fangs.

She howled in rage, trying to throw them off, but more kept coming. The langurs showed no fear, even as several were thrown against temple walls with bone-crushing force. Their sacrifice created the opening Rohan needed.

His hands trembled as he pulled out the ancient weapons. The ornate gauntlets seemed to come alive, their golden surface catching what little moonlight filtered through the temple's shadows. With a silent prayer, he lunged forward and drove the sacred claws deep into Kirana's ribs.

The impact sent a shock wave through his arms. An otherworldly shriek erupted from Kirana's throat, shaking dust from the temple's ancient stones. Her body convulsed as the claws' power connected with something dark and ancient within her. The remaining monkeys scattered as waves of dark energy pulsed from the point of impact.

"You cannot..." The thing wearing Kirana's face gasped, its voice distorting between her natural tone and something far older and filled with hate. "I am eternal... I am..."

The claws began to glow with an intense golden light, cutting through the darkness like divine fire. Rohan held on despite the burning sensation traveling up his arms, knowing he couldn't let go - not now, not when they were so close to freeing her.

Caroline's hands trembled as she gripped her crucifix, its metal warm against her palm. Ancient stone walls of Pura Prajapati loomed around them, their carved surfaces catching the moonlight in ways that made the demons and gods seem to writhe with life. The air crackled with an electricity that had nothing to do with the approaching storm.

"In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti." The Latin rolled off her tongue as naturally as her medical terminology. Before her, Kirana's body twisted at impossible angles, her spine arching backward until her head nearly touched her heels.

Shadows peeled off the temple walls like living tar, coalescing into writhing tentacles that lashed out at the surrounding monkeys. The creatures fell with terrible shrieks, their bodies hitting the stone floor with wet thuds. A sulfurous wind whipped around them, carrying the stench of rot and decay.

"You dare challenge me with your petty prayers?" The voice from Kirana's throat carried centuries of malice. "I who defied the gods themselves?"

Caroline's voice grew stronger, weaving Sanskrit mantras she'd learned from the temple priests between her Catholic rites. The fusion of faiths felt right - good was good, holy was holy, regardless of its source. "Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus."

Thunder crashed overhead in perfect synchronization with her words. The shadow appendages recoiled as if burned. Rohan pressed the sacred claws deeper into Kirana's flesh, drawing an inhuman howl that shattered several nearby clay offerings.

The air vibrated at a frequency that made Caroline's teeth ache. Her hospital scrubs clung to her sweat-soaked skin as she advanced, holding her crucifix before her like a shield. "You have no power here, Hiranyakashipu. Not in this twilight hour, not in this sacred space that is neither inside nor outside."

Lightning split the sky, illuminating the geometric patterns carved into the temple floor - the same patterns they'd found in the cave, but here they served as channels for divine power rather than demonic energy.

Caroline's final prayer rose above the supernatural maelstrom: "By all that is holy, in every tongue and tradition, I command you to release her!"

A massive bolt of lightning pierced the temple's roof, striking Kirana directly in the chest. For a moment, everything froze - the wind, the shadows, even time itself seemed to hold its breath. Then Kirana's body arched one final time as darkness poured from her mouth in a torrent of black mist, dissipating against the temple stones.
