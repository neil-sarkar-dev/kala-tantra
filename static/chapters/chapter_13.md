## Chapter 13

Kirana rubbed her tired eyes, the stark white of her computer screen burning ghostly afterimages into her vision. The lab's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows across the empty workstations. Her coffee had long gone cold, forgotten among the scattered papers and test tubes.

"Nurse Dewi?" She called out, realizing she hadn't seen her assistant in over an hour. The silence that answered made her skin prickle.

The rhythmic beeping of medical equipment created an eerie backdrop as she pushed away from her desk. Her heels clicked against the linoleum floor, each step echoing through the deserted hallway. The motion-sensor lights flickered to life as she walked, but the shadows they cast seemed wrong - stretching longer than they should, moving when they shouldn't.

A metallic scent hit her nostrils. Blood. Fresh blood.

Her pace quickened as she approached the restricted ward where they kept the infected patients from North Sentinel Island. The smell grew stronger, mixing with antiseptic and something else - something ancient and rotting.

The keypad beeped as she entered the security code. The door swung open with a soft hiss.

"Oh god." The words escaped in a whisper.

Nurse Dewi and Patient Zero lay crumpled on the floor, their bodies sprawled in a way that made Kirana's stomach turn. Their limbs were bent at unnatural angles, and their heads had come to rest facing each other in what seemed like a grotesque mockery of intimacy.

Sanskrit symbols had been carved into their flesh, the cuts still weeping red. The same symbols from the cave walls, from the beach, from her nightmares. They formed intricate patterns across the pale skin, telling a story she didn't want to read.

The room tilted. The shadows in the corners writhed and reached for her. Kirana's knees buckled as darkness crept in from the edges of her vision. The last thing she saw before consciousness fled was her own hand, outstretched against the floor, arranged at the exact same angle as the bodies before her.

The sliding doors of Sanglah Hospital parted with a hiss that seemed louder than normal in the pre-dawn quiet. Caroline's footsteps echoed through the empty corridor as she and Rohan made their way to the research wing. The familiar antiseptic smell carried undertones of something else - a metallic tang that reminded her too much of North Sentinel Island.

"The security desk is empty," Caroline noted, her hand brushing against her crucifix. Banks of fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, creating pools of harsh illumination that left the corners in deeper darkness than seemed natural.

"Maybe they're doing rounds?" Rohan's voice cracked as he shifted his backpack.

They found Kirana's lab door ajar. Inside, papers lay scattered across workstations, and several microscopes sat unused, their glass slides left out to collect dust. A coffee cup had tipped over, its contents dried in a brown stain that formed an almost perfect geometric pattern.

"Kirana?" Caroline called out.

Movement in the corner drew their attention. Kirana stood with her back to them, her lab coat wrinkled and stained. When she turned, Caroline's breath caught - gone was the warm, brilliant scientist she'd known. Kirana's face had taken on a waxy pallor, her usual animated expressions replaced by blank detachment.

"You shouldn't have come." Kirana's voice emerged flat, clinical. She gripped the edge of her workstation, knuckles white.

"We came as soon as we got your call about the containment breach." Caroline stepped forward, her medical training kicking in as she assessed Kirana's condition. "What happened to your nurse?"

"Gone. They're all gone." Kirana's lips barely moved as she spoke. She pressed a hand against her abdomen, wincing.

Caroline closed the distance between them. "Let me see."

After a moment's hesitation, Kirana lifted her shirt. An angry red rash spread across her stomach, its center darkened and swollen. The pattern of the inflammation followed no disease Caroline had ever encountered.

"How long?" Caroline asked, pulling on latex gloves.

"Three days. I've been managing it with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but..." Kirana's scientific detachment cracked, fear seeping through. "It's spreading. And it's not just me. The patients, they're showing similar symptoms, but worse. Much worse."

Rohan stepped closer, his face pale. "The same patterns as the Sentinelese?"

"Yes." Kirana pulled her shirt down. "Whatever this is, it's not natural. And I think-" She looked directly at Caroline, her eyes suddenly sharp with clarity, "I think we're all infected. It's just a matter of time before we show symptoms."

Kirana's eyelids grew heavy as she lay in her hospital bed, the rhythmic beeping of monitors lulling her into an uneasy sleep. The sterile white walls blurred and shifted, morphing into the familiar comfort of her laboratory.

Tejas stood by her microscope, his warm smile drawing her closer. "I've been waiting for you," he said, extending his hand.

She reached for him, her heart quickening at his touch. But his fingers felt wrong - cold and rough like dried leather. His face contorted, skin splitting to reveal rows of jagged teeth. Where his eyes had been, empty sockets now held writhing darkness.

"Your soul carries such delicious knowledge," the thing wearing Tejas's face hissed. Its claws dug into her chest, reaching for something vital and ancient within her.

Kirana tried to scream but no sound emerged. The creature's touch burned like acid, spreading black veins across her skin. It pulled at her essence, trying to tear loose something she hadn't known existed inside her.

She jerked awake in her hospital bed, Sanskrit curses spilling from her lips. "Rakshasa," she spat, then caught herself. The word felt foreign yet familiar, dredged up from cultural memories she'd dismissed as superstition.

The darkness pressed against her, thick and alive. Shadows crawled across the ceiling, forming patterns that hurt her eyes. Her degrees, her publications, her years of research - all seemed meaningless against this primal horror.

She fumbled for her phone, desperate to illuminate the room, but the screen remained black. The darkness pulsed with malevolent intent, reaching for her with invisible tendrils. For the first time since childhood, she felt the crushing weight of being truly alone, with nothing but failing logic to shield her from forces that defied explanation.

A sob caught in her throat as she realized how vulnerable she'd made herself. She'd stripped away all spiritual defenses in pursuit of pure science, leaving herself exposed to something ancient and hungry that her microscopes could never capture.
