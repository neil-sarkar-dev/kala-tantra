## Chapter 4

Rohan's heart hammered against his ribs as Captain Singh raised both hands, palms forward. The captain's steady voice cut through the jungle's oppressive heat.

"Everyone stay where you are. No sudden movements."

The wisdom in Singh's words penetrated Rohan's panic. His analytical mind kicked in, cataloging details through the fear. Eight natives emerged from the dense foliage - their bodies decorated with ochre and clay in unfamiliar patterns. They carried traditional spears and arrows, held low but within reach.

"Look at their stance," Rohan whispered to Caroline. "They're not attacking. They're... waiting."

The natives studied their group with an unnerving focus that challenged Rohan's understanding of uncontacted peoples. One of them - tall, with intricate markings across his chest - gestured at the crude trap that had caught their team member. He mimed a boar's movement, then a capturing motion.

Singh's hand rested near his rifle but remained steady. "They're explaining the trap wasn't meant for us."

A branch cracked somewhere in the canopy above. Rohan spun around, his skin prickling with unease. The jungle's background noise had shifted - subtle differences his brain was only now processing. New sounds mixed with the familiar calls of birds and insects. Rhythmic. Deliberate.

The natives maintained their positions, but their attention drifted to the surrounding forest. Their eyes tracked movement through the trees with practiced precision.

"Captain," Rohan's voice came out hoarse. "Something's wrong. They're too calm. Too... prepared for us."

The tribal warriors' expressions remained impassive, revealing nothing. None showed the shock or curiosity typical of a first contact situation. Instead, they watched Rohan's group with the measured attention of those who had seen this all before.

The warriors led them through dense jungle paths, their bare feet silent against the earth. Rohan's shoes felt clumsy in comparison, catching on roots and vines. His mind raced to catalog every detail - the spacing between huts, the smoke patterns from cooking fires, the layout that spoke of generations of optimization.

In the center of the settlement stood a structure larger than the others, its thatched roof weathered but well-maintained. The tall warrior gestured them inside.

An elderly man sat cross-legged on a woven mat, his skin etched with deep lines like a living historical record. Around him lay an assortment of objects that made Rohan's breath catch. Books with cracked spines, their pages warped from salt and humidity. He recognized texts in Hindi and Bengali, technical manuals and religious texts. A battered radio housing. Pieces of fishing nets. Metal containers corroded by decades of exposure.

The elder's eyes crinkled at their reaction. He reached for a Hindi engineering textbook, its cover barely legible through water damage. His fingers traced the symbols with practiced familiarity.

Rohan's mind struggled to process the implications. "He can read?"

The elder rose with surprising grace. Using a stick, he drew in the dirt floor - the same Sanskrit characters they'd seen in the aerial photos. He pointed to himself, then swept his arm toward the beach.

"He did it." Rohan's voice cracked. "He wrote the message. He called us here."

The elder nodded, his expression grave but determined. He gestured at the collected debris - silent witnesses to a century of failed contact attempts - then pointed to the group of outsiders standing in his home.

Rohan's analytical mind shifted into high gear as the elder began to speak. The words came in a fractured mix of languages - ancient Sanskrit mixing with modern Hindi and Bengali in ways that challenged even his IIT-trained intellect.

"Mrityuh... death," the elder traced symbols in the dirt. "Jvara... fever." His weathered hand trembled. "Bhūta... spirits."

Rohan  pieced together the linguistic puzzle, treating each word like a data point in one of his corporate models. The elder's vocabulary seemed cobbled together from generations of exposure to different Indian languages, preserved and morphed in isolation.

"What's he saying?" Caroline leaned forward.

"He's describing some kind of illness." Rohan's fingers twitched, missing his laptop's familiar keyboard. "From what I can gather, it started with the children. High fevers, then..." He paused as the elder made a choking gesture. "Difficulty breathing. It's spread through most of the population."

The elder's next words made Rohan's scientific mindset bristle. "Bhūta ākarṣati - spirits are pulling them away." He mimed something invisible dragging people toward the jungle.

"He believes evil spirits are causing this?" Captain Singh's hand instinctively moved to his weapon.

"That's his interpretation, yes." Rohan kept his skepticism in check. "But the symptoms he's describing sound more like an aggressive respiratory infection. The isolation of this population would make them especially vulnerable to outside diseases."

The elder grabbed Rohan's wrist, his grip surprisingly strong. More words tumbled out, mixing metaphysical claims with concrete observations. Rohan translated the relevant parts, filtering out the supernatural elements. "The illness moves slowly but methodically, they haven't lost anyone yet, but this has never happened before." The elder held up fingers, and Rohan corrected himself. "No… 3 people the past month."

"That's why he reached out," Anika whispered. "They're desperate enough to break centuries of isolation."

Rohan nodded, but his mind was already racing through possibilities. The symptoms, the progression rate, the isolation factor - all variables in an equation he needed to solve. Whatever was affecting these people, it wasn't spirits. But the reality might prove just as frightening.

Caroline stepped forward, keeping her movements slow and deliberate. She held up the medical supplies, making eye contact with the elder whose weathered face bore deep lines of concern.

"We're here to help," she said, touching her hand to her heart. The universal gesture transcended their language barrier.

The elder's eyes narrowed. He jabbed his finger toward the sky, then made sweeping motions through the air - gestures Caroline had seen countless times in her years treating rural communities. The familiar dance of explaining away illness as evil spirits.

Her attention shifted as the elder pointed to each tribesman in turn. His finger finally rested on a small boy, no more than seven, propped against a wooden post. The child's skin carried an unhealthy sheen, his chest rising and falling with labored breaths.

Caroline's medical training kicked in, cataloging symptoms even from this distance. "Anika," she called to her fellow aid worker. "We'll need the PPE kits."

She mimed putting on a mask, then pointed to her stethoscope and made a listening motion against her chest. The elder watched her pantomime with intense focus.

"Blood samples too," she said, holding up a sealed package of syringes. She pressed the tip of one against her own arm in demonstration, careful not to actually pierce the skin.

The elder stroked his chin, eyes darting between Caroline and the sick child. After what felt like an eternity, he nodded. His voice rang out - sharp, commanding syllables that set the warriors into motion.

They moved through the village with military precision, gathering people from their homes. Men, women, children - all filing into the clearing with a mix of fear and resignation on their faces.

"Get the testing kits ready," Caroline told Anika as she pulled on her protective mask. Her hands moved with practiced efficiency, muscle memory from countless similar scenarios. But something about this felt different. The way the villagers' eyes tracked their movements. The absolute silence save for the rustling leaves overhead.

She pushed the unease aside. These people needed help, and that's what she was here to provide. Nothing more, nothing less.

Caroline crouched beside the sick boy, her stethoscope pressed against his back. The rapid, shallow breaths and slight wheeze pointed to respiratory involvement, but the constellation of symptoms didn't align with any common tropical disease she'd encountered in her twenty years of field medicine.

She checked his lymph nodes - swollen. Fever, present but not dangerously high. The rash across his torso showed an unusual pattern, almost geometric in its spread. Her mind raced through possibilities: dengue fever? No, the progression was wrong. Vitamin deficiency from their isolated diet? The symptoms were too acute.

The boy's mother hovered nearby, her dark eyes wide with worry. Caroline gave her what she hoped was a reassuring smile as she jotted observations in her weathered field notebook.

A case from last year's WHO conference in Bangkok flashed through her mind - a presentation on an unusual outbreak in rural Indonesia. That brilliant researcher, Kirana Wijaya, had detailed similar symptoms. Caroline had been impressed by Kirana's methodical approach and innovative thinking. They'd chatted over coffee afterward, exchanging contact information and war stories from their respective clinics.

"Anika," Caroline called, keeping her voice steady despite her growing concern. "How many cases are you seeing with the same symptoms?"

"Seven so far, Dr. Green. All children."

Caroline's pen paused mid-note. The pattern tickled something in her memory - another detail from Kirana's presentation. She needed to consult with her Indonesian colleague as soon as possible.

"Captain Singh," she turned to the military officer. "The communication equipment for the cell tower - when can we get it operational?"

"The first units should be up by tomorrow morning, Doctor."

Caroline nodded, already composing her message to Kirana in her head. The Indonesian researcher's expertise in emerging tropical diseases could prove invaluable here. She'd seen things Caroline hadn't, worked with patterns that might shed light on whatever was affecting these children.

She turned back to her young patient, taking his pulse again. The boy's skin felt cool despite the fever, another anomaly to add to her growing list of contradictions. Whatever this was, she needed more eyes on it, more minds working the problem.

Caroline tucked the last vial of blood into her medical kit with practiced care, each motion precise despite her trembling fingers. Her movements, though efficient, carried the weight of two decades of field experience in remote clinics across India. The samples represented both hope and urgency - a chance to identify whatever had struck down so many of the tribe, leaving their strongest warriors trembling with fever.

"Your measurements were remarkably thorough," Rohan said, watching her label each specimen with meticulous attention to detail. "The statistical significance of your sampling method-"

"When you've seen enough epidemics, you learn to gather every piece of data possible." Caroline closed the case. "We won't get a second chance at this. The disease is moving too quickly."

Captain Singh retrieved his rifle from the tribal elder, exchanging solemn nods that transcended their language barrier. The weapon had served as their gesture of trust, but the cost of that trust lay wrapped in cloth near the village edge. Ravi and Arya's bodies, cleaned and prepared by the warriors according to their ancient customs, served as a grim reminder of their arrival's price. The sweet scent of ceremonial herbs couldn't mask the underlying reality of death.

"We'll return within days," Caroline addressed the gathered tribe through Anika's translation, her British accent cutting through the humid air. "The medicine we bring will help your people." Her words carried the same steady assurance she'd used countless times before in crisis situations, though her eyes lingered on the children showing early symptoms - the slight tremors, the glazed eyes that haunted her medical expertise.

Rohan  pulled out his tablet, then stopped himself mid-motion. The cell tower survey seemed trivial now, almost offensive in the face of their losses and the tribe's suffering. He tucked the device away with an awkward gesture, watching Caroline's careful movements as she secured the samples that might hold the key to the tribe's survival.

"The telecommunications assessment will have to wait," he said, more to himself than the others, his consultant's efficiency giving way to human empathy. "This is... this needs to come first."

"Yes," Caroline agreed, her voice tight with controlled emotion that spoke of too many similar moments in her long career. "It does."
