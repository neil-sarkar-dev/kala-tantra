## Chapter 16

Ocean waves lapped against the shoreline as morning sunlight streamed through the open-air caf√©. Palm fronds cast shifting shadows across their table while ceiling fans spun lazily overhead. The scent of fresh coffee and grilled fish wafted from the kitchen.

Caroline stirred her mango smoothie, the yellow drink matching the sunrise. "I can't remember the last time I just sat and watched the waves."

"You deserve the break." Rohan adjusted his collar, still unused to trading his corporate attire for casual resort wear. "Where will you go first?"

"Thailand, I think. Some friends run a meditation retreat in Chiang Mai." Caroline's shoulders relaxed as she spoke. "After twenty years of constant crisis, I need to learn how to breathe again."

A news anchor's voice cut through their conversation from the mounted TV: "Officials are still investigating the unusual storm that struck Ubud's Sacred Monkey Forest last week. While lightning strikes claimed the lives of several dozen monkeys, experts remain puzzled by the selective nature of the damage..."

Kirana's hand drifted to her side, fingers tracing the bandages beneath her flowing sundress. "At least they found a rational explanation." Her voice carried a hint of dark humor. "Better than 'ancient demon possession claims monkey army.'"

"Speaking of rational explanations," Caroline set down her glass, "the recovery rates across the region are remarkable. Whatever that illness was, it seems to have burned itself out completely."

"Almost like it was never meant to exist in our world at all," Rohan mused, then caught himself. "But that's enough supernatural speculation from me. I'm sticking to cell tower optimization from now on."

"About that..." Kirana leaned forward, her usual scientific intensity softened by something warmer. "We could use someone with your analytical skills here in Bali. The vaccine distribution networks are a mess, especially in the remote areas."

"As long as you can guarantee no ancient temples or mysterious symbols?" Rohan's eyes crinkled with humor.

"Just spreadsheets and supply chains." Kirana's smile held promise. "Though I might know some nice beaches for after-hours consulting."

Caroline watched their exchange with quiet satisfaction. After the horrors they'd faced together, this moment of normalcy felt like its own kind of miracle.

The afternoon sun blazed through the airport's glass walls, casting long shadows across the polished floor. Caroline adjusted her carry-on bag while Rohan hefted her larger suitcase onto a cart.

"You've packed light for someone planning a spiritual journey across Southeast Asia." Rohan pushed the cart through the bustling terminal.

"After what we've been through, material possessions seem less important." Caroline pulled out a small glass vial filled with clear liquid. "This is all I really need."

"From Pura Beji?" Rohan reached into his pocket and produced a smooth, dark stone. "I kept this piece that broke off during... well, that night."

Caroline traced her fingers over her crucifix. "You know, I used to think faith was about rigid boundaries - Catholic, Hindu, Buddhist. But now?" She shook her head. "There's something deeper connecting it all. The temples I'm visiting in Thailand, they're not just tourist stops anymore."

The departure gate loomed ahead, its electronic board flashing "Bangkok" in bright letters.

"Last call for final boarding," crackled over the speakers.

"That's me." Caroline turned to Rohan. "Thank you. For everything."

"Safe travels." Rohan gave her a quick hug.

As Caroline walked through security, she glanced back one last time. Kirana had appeared, her sundress bright against the terminal's neutral tones. She was gesturing animatedly while Rohan leaned in, clearly absorbed in whatever research puzzle she was describing. Caroline smiled and continued toward her gate, her step lighter than it had been in years.

Sunset painted Kuta Beach in shades of amber and rose, the waves rolling in with gentle persistence. Rohan's bare feet sank into the cooling sand as he walked beside Kirana, their shoulders occasionally brushing. The beach stretched before them, dotted with the silhouettes of surfers catching their final waves of the day.

"So these rural clinics," Rohan gestured with his hands as he spoke, falling into his familiar presentation mode, "they're essentially operating blind when it comes to inventory tracking?"

"Classic consultant," Kirana bumped his shoulder playfully. "But yes. Some places don't even have reliable electricity, let alone digital systems. Last month, we had three thousand doses expire because of a communication breakdown."

"That's exactly the kind of inefficiency I love solving." Rohan paused, watching the surf. "Though I have to admit, after everything we've seen, optimizing supply chains feels almost... mundane."

"Mundane is underrated." Kirana's voice carried a hint of hard-won wisdom. "Besides, there's something profound about bridging ancient villages with modern medicine. These communities have centuries of traditional healing knowledge. We're not replacing that - we're adding to it."

They walked in comfortable silence until reaching a quiet stretch of beach. Palm trees swayed in the evening breeze, their fronds casting long shadows across the sand.

"Speaking of traditional knowledge," Kirana turned to face him, "there are some remarkable temples in the mountains. No mysterious symbols or possessed patients, I promise. Just beautiful architecture and fascinating history."

Their laughter carried across the beach, holding notes of shared trauma and relief.

"I'd like that." Rohan's voice softened. "Though maybe we start with coffee first?"

Movement caught their attention - a Hanuman langur perched in a nearby tree, its dark face surprisingly serene as it observed them. The monkey's presence brought a flood of memories, but the fear that once accompanied them had faded to something more like respect.

"Looks like we have approval," Kirana smiled, reaching for Rohan's hand as they continued their walk along the sunny shoreline.
