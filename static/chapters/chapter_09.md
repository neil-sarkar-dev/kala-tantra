## Chapter 9

Rohan's apartment resembled a war room gone wrong. Sanskrit texts spilled across his glass coffee table, sticky notes in yellow, pink, and green crawled up his walls like invasive vines. Red string connected photos and printouts, creating a spider's web of theories that had consumed his living space. The air hung thick with coffee and takeout containers.

His bloodshot eyes darted between his laptop screen and a weathered text on temple architecture. Three days without real sleep left him running on caffeine and obsession. The symbols from the cave photographs haunted him, appearing in his peripheral vision even when he looked away.

"Come on, come on." He rubbed his temples, flipping through another page of temple inscriptions. His cursor hovered over satellite imagery of North Sentinel Island, the coastline's curve matching something he'd seen before.

The realization hit him like a physical blow. He knocked over his coffee mug scrambling for a particular book. There - in a grainy photograph of the Narasimha temple's outer wall - the same interlocking geometric pattern they'd found in the cave. Not similar, identical. His hands shook as he traced the lines.

His head dropped forward, eyelids too heavy to fight anymore. The laptop's glow faded as sleep dragged him under.

Stone pillars rose around him, massive and ancient. Lion-faced gods emerged from the carved columns of the Narasimha temple, their eyes following his movement through the shadows. His bare feet touched cold marble as he approached the inner sanctum.

A figure crouched in the darkness ahead. Not human, not animal - its proportions all wrong. Curved claws scraped against stone, etching familiar patterns. The sound echoed through the temple as the figure's head began to turn.

Rohan jerked awake, heart pounding. His neck ached from sleeping hunched over his desk. The laptop screen had gone dark, reflecting his haggard face in the glass. But the connection remained, burned into his mind - the cave, the temple, the patterns that linked them across centuries.

Caroline stared at the scattered papers covering her normally immaculate desk. Rohan's hands shook as he arranged printouts of temple carvings, archaeological photographs, and his own fevered notes. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, and his usually neat shirt was wrinkled and untucked.

"Look at these markings." His finger traced a geometric pattern from a temple photograph. "This is from the Narasimha temple in Karnataka. Now compare it to the symbols we found near those cobra sacrifices."

Caroline leaned forward, studying the images. The similarity was undeniable - both featured the same precise angular cuts arranged in a distinctive pattern. Her hand unconsciously moved to the silver crucifix at her neck.

"The legend of Hiranyakashipu tells of a king who performed extreme rituals to gain divine favor," Rohan's voice cracked with exhaustion. "According to the stories, he was granted special protection through specific conditions - he couldn't be killed by man or beast, not inside or outside, not during day or night." Caroline recalled the ancient Sanskrit texts she'd studied during her early years in India - how the story of Hiranyakashipu had spread from the heartland of the Gupta Empire through trade routes that stretched from Afghanistan to Indonesia. Merchants and scholars had carried these tales along with their silks and spices, each region adding its own interpretation. In some versions, Hiranyakashipu's kingdom had stretched across the entire known world, his influence reaching as far as the Greek territories. Archaeological evidence from the 5th century showed that temples commemorating his defeat had been built throughout the subcontinent, their ruins still bearing the distinctive architectural features of that era. The king's reputation had been so feared that even Buddhist texts from that period contained indirect references to his rule.

He pulled out another set of photos - the delirious sketches made by Kirana's patients in Bali. The same geometric patterns appeared in their feverish drawings.

"These patterns keep appearing. In the cave, in ancient texts, in the victims' minds." Rohan spread more documents across the desk. "The symptoms match historical accounts of villages that encountered-"

"Stop." Caroline raised her hand. The medical professional in her wanted to dismiss this as the ravings of an exhausted mind, but she couldn't ignore the evidence before her. The precise geometric arrangements in the photos aligned too perfectly with what they'd witnessed on the island - the unnatural stillness, the positioned corpses, the eerie compliance of the usually fierce Sentinelese.

"What exactly are you suggesting, Rohan?"

"I don't know." He slumped into a chair. "But whatever's happening on that island, it's happened before. And it's connected to something ancient, something that follows rules we don't understand."

Caroline picked up one of the patient drawings, noting how the clean lines contrasted with the shaky hand that had drawn them. Her medical training struggled against the weight of what she'd witnessed - the cave of skulls, the ritualistic positioning, the spreading illness that defied scientific explanation.

Exhausted from their grueling journey through winding mountain roads, Caroline and Rohan stared at the ancient stone edifice of the Shri Narsingh Mandir Joshimath temple, the Narasimha temple. The structure's weathered walls rose before them, its intricate carvings worn smooth by centuries of harsh Himalayan winters. Prayer flags fluttered in the thin mountain air, their vibrant colors stark against the temple's gray stone facade. Behind the temple, the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas pierced the clouds like ancient guardians, their massive presence both awe-inspiring and oppressive in the crystalline mountain light.

The temple's position, nestled at an altitude where even breathing required conscious effort, spoke to the devotion of those who had built it centuries ago. Local legend held that the temple's Narasimha idol, half-man and half-lion, housed a divine prophecy in its slowly shrinking right arm - a countdown to when the nearby Badrinath Temple would eventually close its doors forever.

Mahabharata legend had it that Narasimha was Vishnu's most ferocious avatar, manifesting to defeat the demon king Hiranyakashipu. Rohan recalled the ancient texts he'd studied, how they described the demon king's reign of terror across the Indian subcontinent in the Treta Yuga era, when trade routes from the Indus Valley to distant Lanka had fallen under his iron grip. The stories spoke of how Hiranyakashipu had corrupted the sacred spaces between the Himalayas and the seas, turning temples into fortresses of dark worship.

The temple before them stood as testament to that pivotal battle - where Narasimha, neither fully man nor beast, had emerged at twilight, neither day nor night, to defeat a tyrant who thought himself untouchable. Looking at the weathered stone walls, Rohan  could almost imagine the echoes of that ancient conflict, when according to Sanskrit chronicles, the very mountains had trembled as god and demon clashed. Local priests still maintained that Hiranyakashipu's influence lingered in these peaks, his essence bound but not destroyed, waiting in the shadows between the mortal world and the divine.

The ancient stone steps led them higher into the thin Himalayan air. Rohan's legs burned from the climb, but his mind raced faster than his heartbeat. The Narasimha temple emerged from the mist, its weathered walls a testament to centuries of devotion and secrets.

Inside, fluorescent tubes cast harsh shadows across worn stone floors. The modern lighting felt like an intrusion, failing to properly illuminate the vast chamber. His eyes adjusted to the dimness, drawn to the relief carvings that covered the walls.

"Look at this." He traced his finger along a geometric pattern beneath a carving of Narasimha. The same interlocking shapes he'd seen in the cave, in his research, in his dreams. "The symbols aren't just similar - they're identical."

Caroline stepped closer, her crucifix catching the weak light. "The metallic smell... it's like the medical tent."

The scent hit him too - that sharp, copper tang that had permeated the air around the sick Sentinelese. Here it mixed with sandalwood incense and mountain dust, creating something both familiar and alien.

His hand brushed against the cold stone wall, following the flowing lines of a battle scene. Narasimha emerged from a pillar, neither man nor beast, to confront the demon king. The artistry was exceptional, each claw and fang rendered with terrifying precision.

"These carvings tell the whole story." His voice echoed in the chamber. "Hiranyakashipu gained his power through ritual sacrifice. The geometric patterns were part of it - they're instructions, not warnings."

The shadows in the corners seemed to deepen as a cloud passed over the sun outside. One of the fluorescent tubes flickered and buzzed, its dying light creating moving shadows across the ancient reliefs.

"There's more." He pointed to a worn section near the floor. "See how these lines match the patterns we found near those impaled cobras? This isn't coincidence."
