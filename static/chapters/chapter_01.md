## Chapter 1

Rohan Kumar stared at his laptop screen until the numbers blurred together. Another day, another telecom churn analysis. The same old story of customers jumping between carriers for marginally better data plans. He'd run the same predictive models so many times he could recite the Python code in his sleep.

The office hummed with the white noise of corporate life - keyboards clicking, hushed conversations about KPIs, and CNBC droning from wall-mounted displays. A stock ticker crawled across the bottom of the nearest screen, its red and green numbers fighting for attention he couldn't spare.

He stretched, his ergonomic chair creaking in protest. His latest model showed a 0.2% improvement in customer retention if the client implemented his recommendations. Hardly groundbreaking stuff.

"That Q4 deadline's coming up fast." Priya from the next desk over spoke to no one in particular, her voice carrying the practiced stress of consulting veterans.

"Tell me about it." Rahul leaned back in his chair. "Three decks due by Friday, and the client keeps changing scope."

Their voices faded into the background as Rohan pulled up another spreadsheet. Ten million rows of call detail records stared back at him. Each entry represented someone's conversation, reduced to cold data points - duration, location, network quality. He'd traded his dreams of solving real mysteries for this - hunting patterns in people's phone habits to squeeze out fractional improvements in profit margins.

The office's glass walls reflected his image: crisp blue shirt, perfect posture, the very picture of a successful consultant. Yet his eyes kept drifting to the browser tab where his personal blog sat minimized. His latest draft about the mathematical impossibilities in ancient temple architecture remained unfinished, a guilty pleasure he couldn't indulge during billable hours.

"Hey Rohan, you're looking at Airtel's data, right?" A voice cut through his thoughts. "Marketing team needs those segmentation numbers by EOD."

He nodded, already copying the familiar formulas. Another day of turning human behavior into pivot tables. The air conditioning hummed overhead, a monotonous drone matching the rhythm of his keyboard strokes.

A sudden shift in the CNBC broadcast's tone caught Rohan's attention. The market analysis cut to a breaking news banner across the screen's lower third.

"We're bringing you exclusive footage from the Andaman Sea," the anchor announced. "A US military patrol aircraft captured these images near North Sentinel Island just hours ago."

Rohan's fingers froze over his keyboard. The grainy aerial footage showed pristine beaches and dense jungle canopy. But what drew his eye weren't the hostile shores where the Sentinelese had maintained their isolation for millennia - it was the unusual patterns etched into the sand.

"Satellite imagery has confirmed what appears to be Sanskrit-like markings on the island's eastern beach," the reporter continued. "Experts are puzzled by their sudden appearance, as the indigenous Sentinelese have no known writing system."

The camera zoomed in on the markings. Despite years away from his Sanskrit classes, Rohan recognized elements that resembled the ancient script. The patterns were remarkably straight and uniform, raising questions about their origin.

"Hey, check this out." He turned to Priya, but she was already deep in a client call, nodding along to unseen demands. Rahul had his headphones on, lost in spreadsheet formulas.

The broadcast switched to a panel of experts debating the authenticity of the footage. Their voices faded into background noise as Rohan opened a new browser tab. His fingers moved faster than his thoughts, searching for additional coverage. Government websites, archaeological forums, satellite imagery archives - he needed data, context, anything to make sense of what he'd seen.

That familiar surge of curiosity rose within him, the same one that drove him to spend countless nights researching temple architecture and ancient astronomical calculations. This wasn't like his usual mysteries - this was happening now, barely 800 kilometers from the mainland.

The news segment ended as abruptly as it began, returning to market updates and earnings forecasts. Around him, the office carried on its usual rhythm. Keyboards clicked, phones rang, deadlines loomed. But the image of those strange markings remained fixed in his mind, their precise geometry challenging everything he thought he knew about North Sentinel Island's isolation.

He minimized his work files and opened his blog draft. The half-finished article about temple mathematics suddenly felt trivial compared to what he'd just witnessed. His cursor blinked in an empty document, waiting for words that would make sense of the unexplained.

Rohan slipped away from his usual lunch spot, finding a quiet corner in the office cafeteria. His fingers flew across the keyboard, diving deep into North Sentinel Island's history. The screen's glow reflected in his glasses as he created a new folder titled "Sentinel Anomaly."

"The most isolated tribe on Earth," he muttered, copying key details into his notes. The Sentinelese had rejected contact with the outside world for over 60,000 years, their isolation predating even the great maritime expeditions of the Chola dynasty that had once dominated these waters. Every attempt at peaceful communication had ended in violence - from the British expedition in 1880 that kidnapped several elderly islanders, to the missionaries who'd met their end at the hands of the hostile tribe.

A Wikipedia rabbit hole led him to the 2004 tsunami. The Sentinelese had survived by reading natural signs and retreating to higher ground, displaying an ancient wisdom that echoed the seafaring knowledge of their Andamanese ancestors, who had navigated these waters since the time of the Pallava kingdom's trade routes. When Indian helicopters flew overhead to check for survivors, they were met with a barrage of arrows.

"But why carve those markings?" Rohan sketched the strange patterns he'd seen in the broadcast. One section looked familiar, but the rest remained indecipherable. The Sentinelese had their own language, completely unknown to linguists. Ancient Indian scripts would be as foreign to them as computer code - though ironically, their island had once been a crucial waypoint for Sanskrit-speaking merchants traveling between the Gupta Empire and Southeast Asian kingdoms.

He pulled up satellite imagery of the island. Dense jungle covered most of the twenty-eight square miles, with only a thin strip of beach visible. The image quality was poor around the coastline, the resolution breaking down near the water's edge - a modern echo of the ancient maritime charts used by Arab traders who, according to recovered documents from the 9th century, had learned to give the island a wide berth after losing several ships to its defenders.

"That's odd." He cross-referenced with older satellite photos. The same poor quality appeared in all of them, the coastline consistently unclear in every image.

The rumors of cannibalism caught his attention next. No concrete evidence existed, but historical accounts from neighboring islands painted a dark picture. The Andaman tribes had practiced ritualistic cannibalism until the late 1800s. The Sentinelese remained the only group with zero confirmed peaceful contact.

Rohan checked the time - lunch break nearly over. He saved his notes, but the strange markings troubled him. The precise nature of the carving suggested tools beyond what the tribe possessed. And the size - visible from news helicopters meant it spanned at least thirty feet across the beach.

He pulled up the news footage again, frame by frame. The video quality deteriorated just as the camera panned across the carvings. For a split second, the image distorted, becoming unrecognizable before clearing again.

Caroline Green jerked awake, her heart pounding. The children's faces from her dream lingered - gaunt, feverish, their eyes clouded with pain. Her small office at the mission felt suffocating, the afternoon heat pressing against the windows.

A knock at the door cut through her disorientation. "Sister Mary?"

"Dr. Green, you need to see this." The young novice's voice carried an unusual urgency.

Caroline straightened her wrinkled blouse and smoothed back loose strands of hair. "Come in."

Sister Mary rushed to Caroline's desk, tablet in hand. "The message from North Sentinel Island - they've enhanced the satellite images."

Caroline studied the screen. Strange markings were carved into the beach sand, visible despite the grainy quality of the photo. Her medical training kicked in, mind already cataloging possibilities. Cholera. Dengue. Malaria. The tribes had no immunity to outside diseases.

"It seems to be a distress signal," Caroline said, examining the markings carefully. "They wouldn't break centuries of isolation without cause. Water contamination perhaps, or a serious outbreak."

"But what language is it? The Sentinelese have their own."

Caroline frowned. The question nagged at her too, but medical priorities overrode academic curiosities. "Right now, the how matters less than the why. If they're facing a health crisis, every hour counts."

The dream images flashed again - children writhing in hospital beds, their skin mottled with unknown symptoms. She pushed the memory aside. This was real, not a nightmare. These people needed help.

"Have the authorities made any decisions about mounting a rescue?" Caroline asked.

Sister Mary shook her head. "They're still debating. The tribe's history of violence has everyone hesitant."

Caroline stood and walked to her window. The mission's medical garden stretched below, herbs and plants she'd learned to use from local healers. Twenty years of building trust in this region, learning to bridge worlds. Perhaps that experience could help here too.

"Those people have survived in isolation for over 60,000 years," she said. "Whatever's driven them to reach out now must be devastating."

Caroline ran her fingertip over the faded margins of her physician's credentials, the document tinted amber from twenty years exposed to India's damp air. A string of outbreaks, catastrophes, and backcountry medical emergencies had transformed her from a wide-eyed new graduate into a battle-tested doctor. She'd built a name for herself managing dire situations, gaining confidence from both tribal settlements and state authorities.

Watching her brother succumb to polio during childhood had driven Caroline toward medicine. Coming from devout parents, she'd chosen to become a sister - the religious path giving her the unwavering spiritual core needed to sustain her humanitarian medical work.

The Sanskrit message weighed heavily on her mind. She'd treated isolated tribes before, but the Sentinelese were different. Their complete separation from modern medicine meant no antibiotics, no vaccines, no basic healthcare knowledge. A simple flu could devastate their population.

Her office walls displayed certificates from emergency response training, tropical disease management, and cultural integration programs. Each one represented lessons learned, often the hard way. But this situation was unprecedented.

Caroline picked up her phone, scrolling to Dr. Rajesh Mehta's number. As the head of India's Emergency Medical Response Team, he'd supported her work with remote communities before.

"Rajesh? It's Caroline Green."

"Caroline, I was wondering when you'd call about Sentinel Island."

"Then you know why I'm reaching out." She shifted in her chair, choosing her words carefully. "The world's rushing forward - smartphones, internet, global travel. But they've maintained their isolation. Whatever's changed that..."

"It's delicate, Caroline. The tribe's protection status-"

"Their protection won't matter if they're facing a medical crisis. That Sanskrit message - it's a cry for help."

"And you're suggesting?"

"A small team. Medical personnel only. No media, no anthropologists, no cameras. Just doctors with emergency supplies." Caroline leaned forward, her voice firm. "I've spent twenty years building relationships with isolated communities. Let me try to reach them."

The line went quiet. Caroline waited, knowing Rajesh was weighing decades of policy against the urgency of the situation.

"I'll bring it to the committee," he said finally. "But Caroline - be prepared for resistance. A lot of it."

"People are suffering, Rajesh. Every day we debate is another day they're waiting for help."

After ending the call, Caroline studied the satellite image again. The Sanskrit characters filled her with a deep sense of foreboding. She'd seen that kind of desperation before - in earthquake zones, in flood-ravaged villages, in disease outbreaks. But something about this felt different. More primal. More urgent.
